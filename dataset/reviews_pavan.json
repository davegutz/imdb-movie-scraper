Before Game of Thrones with the exception of Breaking Bad and maybe a few other series, very few had kept me glued from beginning to end. It also did what few have done and not only kept you guessing from episode to episode (whether it be who falls in love, who changes from good to evil, who dies, who comes back, new relationships made, old friendships ending and so on)but also built from the first season to the last progressively. It had an extremely grounded, reastic, morbid, grim, brutal, sad, and other negative effects type of storytelling with few bouts of positive triumph, but that's what made it amazing. Because the dark moments sure become so much lighter when everything seems to be lost. Although many won't approve because of the liberal use of nudity, sexualism, profanity and graphic violence, I defend it wholeheartedly. What in the news and nowadays otherwise is all that much different, at least this one has good writing and equal elements of good. The art direction is impeccable, the writing and acting are perfect across the board, and the visual effects and practical effects are outstanding, especially given this is a tv series and they are better than what most fantasy movies put out. I can't applaud the actors enough, the supporting actors made most lead actors in other series look like amateurs, the leads made most of those in their class look like supporting actors and the good definitely made it easy to cheer for them while the evil were more than capable of carrying out a good effort for people to hate them.

Noble families, who control each kingdom and their bannermen fight over the Iron throne and the control of Westeros. All the while a force of half-dead walkers arise after thousands of years in the Land of Always Winter. The story is mostly based around The Starks (noble family of the North), the Lannisters (noble family of the West and the rulers from the shadows) and the Targaryens (the family that united Westeros with the help of dragons) which was exiled and banished to Essos (another continent). The first 6 seasons are phenomenal! Politics, wars, intrigue, mysteries, pacts and betrayals. A lot of characters are perfectly described psychologically (especially Cersei Lannister, Tyrion and Tywin Lannister, Catelyn Stark and Olenna Tyrell).

There are especially 2 main things I do want to write one is music and other is sets. Man, the sets are so good that you feel that there is actually a Westeroas in the real world. The graphics are great but in the whole season there are only two or three scenes where you feel that the graphics are graphics. You can actually see that. And casting is one of the most positive aspect. The actors just loved in the characters. At first you feel that this charecter is good and in the next season you will like him especially Jamie Lannister. The stories of each character is so good that you want to see more of it of each character. And the ending couldn't be any better.

The cast, cinematography, and writing (to be continued) is incredible. These factors leave you greatly invested in the storyline so much that the last two seasons are really a knife to the heart. So much beautiful set up is betrayed by sloppy writing, rushed plots, and corny outcomes: things you would never expect to see in a show of this impecability. However, with the absolute trash writing that comes with season 7 and 8, the cast never loses their touch. One can truly see what a talented bunch of actors are present in this show when they must completely switch their characters without much room for transition. With the boring dialogue and cheesy scenes, these actors maintain their dignity and great work. This show was always ten stars for me but this final season, especially, led me to remove 4 stars and that is being extremely generous. It feels as if all this investment, all the prophecies, all the preparation present in this show was wasted on that ending. The final episode tried so hard to create a twist that it made little sense and tied no loose ends. The only character development and storyline that followed through was Sansa's and that is probably the only part of this season that kept me watching.

The legends of the iron throne destroyed by Drogon, and the kings/queens fighting from season 1, die or get carried away.

Is it possible to scream out \"We don't care about this bs anymore\" more than that? That's exactly what they are saying... I can't even fit all the plot holes in this review so I will only point out my biggest issues with this season ... Like how can Jon be sentenced to the wall that isn't even needed anymore as the white walkers are gone and that was its original use and what about the fact that the north is finally its own country so they have no jurisdiction there and the wall is part of the north? Or the fact that considering that he was actually first in line to be king as a direct descendent of the prince who was to be the king that they would even be able to arrest him? (Visarys was in line after Jon and Dany would have been after Visarys) Or the fact that technically he was still the King in the North and never abdicated his throne. Bending the knee is not abdicating. How did the Dothraki go from being completely wiped out in ep 3 to being around magically again after? I saw Dany's decent into madness coming unfortunately, from the time she burned all the Khals and crucified the slave traders, or when she had Xaro and Doreah locked inside the merchant prince's vault left to die. To the time she killed Sam's father and brother just because they refused to \"bend the knee\".... all actions of a conquerer or a dictator not a liberator. Going to those extremes just to prove her point and teach a lesson. However they rushed her final decent into full madness waaaaay too fast in season 8 to the point that its like whiplash. Her obsession with the iron throne evident throughout the series but everything came about so gradually that it was easy to overlook. They really should have made this last season a full season and done things right. Or if this was what they they were going to turn out as the finished sloppy copy of the rushed series finale then they should have just added it on to last season. Making everyone wait for 2 years then not even being able to edit properly for coffee cups and water bottles is beyond disappointing. They may as well have just had the Night King win and everyone die... Cersei getting to die romantically in Jaime's arms as the world crumbled around them? I mean seriously? After everything she did? She deserved to die in a slow agonizing way. Nothing would have been too much.\nThis seriously could have been the greatest show created to date (aside from SOA lol) but this last season not only damaged the overall rating of the show but also makes half of the things you learn as plots are unveiled completely pointless and useless.

I thought this was one of the greatest shows I had ever watched , one of the greatest stories ever told. Whatever.\nUp till season 8, this might be true.\nAt season 8, the show pivots.\nIt isn't the dragons, the dead zombies. Or the little children that become the fantasy.\nSee this show had so much about it that made it what it was. That made it cross over to a wide range of people, places etc..\nI think the characters were so beloved and the story was so beloved that at season 8, when the writers thought they could take it all and smash it again, it didn't work. It didn't make sense. And it doesn't matter if there was a fantasy aspect to it - we needed the characters to make sense, to ring true.\nSeason 8, became a lie.\nNothing made sense.\nBeloved characters started making no sense. The writers started pulling our legs, trying to be funny. Trying to shock.\nBasically season 8 everything took a dump and the writers really started trying too hard. Trying too hard to make an impression and trying too hard to entertain and shock us and come up with the same shock and awe of the previous seasons - but they didn't have the author or his story to relay on anymore and it shows.\nNothing made sense.\nSeason 8 becomes so shockingly sexist and stereotypical , when it really wasn't trying to. In fact I wager they thought they were doing something revolutionary. But in the end, after several seasons. It just became a lie.\nThis guy can forgive anyone and every man gets redemption- no matter the awful deeds they do. In fact men can commit atrocities and become better people! But not women. . You can tell the writers are religious.\nThe show becomes so shockingly bad and the ending is just about the most awful series of choices and decisions on the part of the writers - that the entire show doesn't deserve its high rating anymore.\nI hope everyone comes back and changes their initial vote ( take your 10 and turn it into a 2) so that the rating can accurately reflect the show at this point.\nThat ending ruined the show.\nI'm sorry but GOT isn't the same show.\nThe ending has forever altered it.

The title tell you all you need to know. Power. The pursuit of power, the attainment of power, and the difficulty of holding power. The question is, can they stick the landing. They did not. They had a choice in season 8 to be Shakespearean or to be Dynasty. To be or not to be a tragedy or to be a cliche Hollywood trope. Trope it is.\nIn the beginning the Stark clan is not much of a power player but the Lannister are. By the end they both are consummate duplicitous players. The \"gaslighting\" of Daenerys and Jon over the revelation they are aunt and nephew, which neither were aware of until revealed to them is the worst part of the epic failed ending. A few more minutes in each episode of them attempting to deal with the information, showing them attempting to stay connected physically beyond the meager attempts shown would have made a difference. It left me wondering, does he still really love her? One doesn't know because there no scene of him or her alone struggling with his or her thoughts holding something that represents each other, crying or clutching that object. Hell, Jamie and Cersei got a better fully realized emotional death scene then Daenerys. And Daenerys was just as psychically wounded a character as Cersei was. Why is her death scene so mechanical, cold and to borrow a phrase, done \"with extreme prejudice?\" The justification. She is turning into Colonel Kurtz\" and \"Hitler.\" Actually, she is \"gaslighted\" into it by the Starks. She is no longer useful to them and way too powerful to control. She has the dragon. That makes her a superpower. It's hard to kill the dragon now. She is not. Her willingness to use violence is open and has always been known, but so is Arya's. She and Jon and Arya are probably the least duplicitous main characters in the series. The rest of them get others to do the dirty work. The other epic fail of the series end is the unwillingness the treat the Starks and Tyrion as the cunning players for the game of pursuing the throne. They are portrayed as survivors and heroes of the game for the throne. They are not. Nor is Tyrion. As for the assassination of Daenerys, Jon is reduced to a plot prop as \"an errand boy, sent by grocers to collect a bill \" to borrow another phase. Finally, Drogon torching the throne and melting it to the ground isn't because it's represents evil. It's because it belongs to Daenerys and no one will ever sit on it again.

But to sum it all up, just know that if you are really into maybe The Lord Of The Rings/The Hobbit or maybe a little bit of the Harry Potter kind of area, it takes a LITTLE of those fantasy aspects to the EXTREME, and throws them into a very harsh and oddly addicting universe, and although I'll admit the show has several flaws over the seasons sometimes due to this very extreme and intense nature, I want you to hear me when I seriously tell you that all of the good parts make the bad parts worth it, especially if you make it to season 6 (the last two episodes of that season are the best in the show if not in any show), is GOT for everyone? Doubt it, no show seems to be, but it's good enough that it really is worth a try, I wouldn't watch it if blood makes you sick, if violence disturbs you.

I was invested for years it just kept getting better, so many unforgettable moments. They ran out of content and just didn't know what to do, there not GRRM not even close. Since the pilot it we knew the main threat was the white walkers, it all built up to the battle to end all battles, 8 years we waited for that they've finally breached the wall and then reached Winterell and it all just fell so flat... Ayra stabs the night king then that's it. It was just such a terrible decision, the worst ending to that arc imaginable. I would of preferred the army of the dead to kill everyone at Winterfell then march to Kings Landing and kill 99% of everyone there in a huge gigantic battle and let a few people escape on ships to Essos. The very last scene of GOT should've been Cersei looking back at The Night King truly and utterly terrified after witnessing a massacre and the realisation that \"all those stories\" she dismissed as nonsense are in fact true. The night king stares directly at Cersie as he did with Jon at Hardhome. He then proceeds to raise thousands of the dead as Cersie sails away to Essos and then cut to black. That would of been truly terrifying and unsettling. GOT was never been a show that give you a happy ending. It slaughtered characters you really cared about like Ned and Robb stark. The execution of Ned and the red wedding are such shocking moments. Having everyone at the end be fine and brann as king was so stupid I hated it so much he turned into a terrible character who literally contributed nothing but ends up on top. Then Jaime goes back and dies in rubble with Cersie ruining one of my favourite characters. Cleganebowl happens just for fan service and the hound dies I would've personally kept him alive past end scene. And don't get me started on dani just randomly turning psycho out the blue for no reason killing everyone. All she had to was go the red keep and burn it down with cersie in it. Then drogon burns the iron throne for no reason. 90% of GOT fans could've written better ending that this drivel. Never the less still a really amazing show for the most part and one I will never forget. Looking forward to the prequels too.

I'd say my least favorite season was season 2 personally but I loved every season. Season 8 is no doubt a bottom 3 season for pretty much everyone but like I said I love all the seasons. Best seasons were 4,1,6 best episode was winds of winter. I just love this show and I'm rewatching it again already. After I I finished breaking bad I didn't really feel the need to rewatch the whole show despite being shorter. Game of thrones was a journey. One I feel will never ever be topped. I know it's hard to compare a drug drama to a fantasy show with probably 30x the amount of characters but that's the easiest way to compare. The only complaint I can really think of is the fact they didn't show Jon telling his sisters his true identity. And how the (bad worded) over Jaime Lannister. Does it make sense that he would go back to Cersei? Yes I see this as pretty realistic seeing as Jaime as a person is very dependent on Cersei for pretty much 7 seasons his main intentions involve Cersei. Does it make it less infuriating that he died in such a way? Not really. He had one of the best arcs in the show just for him to go back after having sex with Brienne. If ur gonna go back to Cersei why you gotta (offensive name for sexual intercourse) her bro. It just feels like his whole intention in the last 3 episodes was to make the audience feel bad for Cersei when she ends up dying. Which I would say they succeeded honestly I just which they didn't flush jaimes last episode or two on the show down the toilet. There were other ways of doing such a thing. She could've died after giving birth or something and then the building could still tumble on her giving off the same effect. Aside from that it's a perfect show and I still see the show as flawless in my eyes even thought technically it isn't.

You cannot compare a show like breaking bad to game of thrones and even though breaking bad is great it was saved by a good ending everything else was dominated by game of thrones, any other show can be compared but look at any part of game of thrones and compare it with that show for the first 7 seasons and notice the gap in quality then take the last season and compare them, does the quality make up for it, I doubt it. Please don't be deterred from watching this show it is a masterpiece and deserves more respect and I hope the prequel series can bring the name up to a cornerstone of pop culture once again where it deserves to be.

I don't mind the events but only if each event was done in a proper manner which makes them important not cramming all the important stuff in 6 episodes. Hear me out let's say season 8 was against the night king and in the last episode he dies. And season 9 would've been Cersei killing danys dragon and missandei\nWe would have seen Dany going mad and see what causes her to burn down a whole city\nBut season 8 literally shifts the character 180\nWe don't see her change or grieve instead it's like the writers wanted to fill in between the lines and anyway to continue the final season (season 10) would have been the mad queen and how they would remove her. They literally cram all this in 6 freaking episodes. The audience felt like a lot of important stuff was happening that it underweighed the season.\nOverall the season events weren't bad. But d&d wanted to fit 3 seasons in one and that didn't work out properly", "review_date": "7 July 2020", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "hamzazadjalixbox", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur120452546/", "data-review-id": "rw5876858", "short_review": "One of the best shows ever", "full_review": "Everyone has to watch , the story is amazing , the show is great and the characters are wonderful", "review_date": "3 July 2020", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "Pukeonthestreet", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur113529171/", "data-review-id": "rw5474982", "short_review": "There's a reason everyone likes it", "full_review": "It's not over hyped.

I was looking forward to the new show, considering it said it wasn't the story we thought we knew, but now that it's off the table, I'm over it. book readers will know that the others in the books are different from the show, especially with the addition of NK, so we got what we got in the show and we will get what we get in the books. as for other characters... if you didn't see it coming then I don't really know what to tell you. sorry.", "review_date": "27 December 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "joshuaevanepstein", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur32962220/", "data-review-id": "rw5181173", "short_review": "Rating Lowered From 10 to 7", "full_review": "", "review_date": "12 October 2019", "rating_value": "7"}, {"reviewer_name": "gabo_alepb", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur68134243/", "data-review-id": "rw5106741", "short_review": "It went down like the ice wall", "full_review": "", "review_date": "7 September 2019", "rating_value": "8"}, {"reviewer_name": "lynxenn", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur27918206/", "data-review-id": "rw5079811", "short_review": "Don't watch the final season.", "full_review": "", "review_date": "25 August 2019", "rating_value": ""}, {"reviewer_name": "michaelgallagher-95127", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur72635748/", "data-review-id": "rw4991484", "short_review": "Wasted something special", "full_review": "Whole last season made no sense.No story.Couldnt see the battle.Absolutely no replay value for the whole series now.Ridiculous,greedy and shameful", "review_date": "12 July 2019", "rating_value": "3"}, {"reviewer_name": "MarkassBrownie", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur81122319/", "data-review-id": "rw4924220", "short_review": "Re-judgement of GOT.", "full_review": "", "review_date": "9 June 2019", "rating_value": "5"}, {"reviewer_name": "bakybateman", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur104158677/", "data-review-id": "rw4922747", "short_review": "Great till season 7", "full_review": "", "review_date": "9 June 2019", "rating_value": "5"}, {"reviewer_name": "JerrrrrrrySaaks", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur103609018/", "data-review-id": "rw4894776", "short_review": "Used to be so good................ what happened.............", "full_review": "", "review_date": "28 May 2019", "rating_value": "3"}, {"reviewer_name": "Ivanovo_04", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur45468272/", "data-review-id": "rw4889423", "short_review": "What a waste", "full_review": "It was one of my favorites shows but with those 2 last seasons, and especially that ending, I can not recommend it any more..", "review_date": "26 May 2019", "rating_value": ""}, {"reviewer_name": "qutaiba_zz", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur70692647/", "data-review-id": "rw4877472", "short_review": "Bad ending of all time", "full_review": "It was the greatest until season 8 destroyed everything", "review_date": "21 May 2019", "rating_value": "6"}, {"reviewer_name": "mmq-02263", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur103284300/", "data-review-id": "rw4877143", "short_review": "The best show, but the ending was the worst", "full_review": "The ending was absolutely not logical, I was really sad that this great show ended this way.", "review_date": "21 May 2019", "rating_value": "7"}, {"reviewer_name": "zahraayas", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur103192923/", "data-review-id": "rw4868774", "short_review": "The final episode", "full_review": "Why jon is a targerin?

I was a late adopter, having been initially repulsed by the lasiviousness, lewd, violent coarseness of the show (I think I watched one random episode and recoiled). Then, when the popularity of the show skyrocked, my curiousity lead me to start at the beginning and give the show a chance. I binged what I'd missed, then watched it episodically as it was broadcast, then, just before the beginning of each new season, I would binge the previous season, just to be caught up and ready to go. All those things that originally repelled me where still all there in abundance but the story telling, the characters, the acting, the quality of the production, and the human drama, on an epic scale, held my fascination and it became a guilty pleasure (so, watching, but not reviewing). Then, the production overshot the source material and the direction became less crisp and the characters struggled to find their footing. Finally, the end was near, and production values soared to Movie-of-the-Week standards. The last season ended and the audience was stunned. Some with disappointment (wounded by the trajectory of the plot and their beloved characters). Some with grief (no more GAME OF THRONES!?!). Some with sense overload (What did I just see?!?). I was in that category. It took days to reconcile what I had just watched. My only clear thought was, \"Well...they had to end it some way.\" I was sure they could not have ended it in a way that would have satisfied everyone. Is there ever a good time/way to watch a beloved thing die? So, now, 53 days after the last episode was broadcast, I am summoning up the courage to write my review. This was a landmark series. It set the bar for non-network television productions: the story, acting, technical magic, locations, international cast, budget, quality were all the best of the best. For me, it will always be about story and characters: George R.R. Martin's concepts were epic and compelling; I can't imagine a better cast or better performances (indeed they harvested from some of the greatest while also forging a new generation of talent). No matter where you land with the ending (and I'm still not sure how I feel about it) this has been a tremendous ride and it has change our landscape of expectations.

There is much better action and romance out there. The only reason to carry on watching at this point is to get conclusions on the dense story line and character development one has invested in over the previous 6 seasons. Over its final two seaons, the show however lets down almost every single story arch and becomes entirely plot driven. The characters turn into hollow shells of their former selves and their actions hugely inconsistent.

And until the end of season 6 it was. The show had everything: superb writing, outstanding production values, epic scale, gritty and complex characters, likable villains and unlikable heroes, blood and guts, plenty of suspense and let's not forget some pretty frank treatment of sex too. The show was very modern (e.g. Most of its surviving leading characters were women), without being preachy or shrill about it. One of the GOT's most appealing aspects has always been that it's hard to distinguish heroes from villains here, and the show tries hard tp prevent the viewers from classifying the characters in those terms. (Of course, there are exceptions, like Joffrey.) While over time the audience gets more and more emotionally invested in the characters of Daeneris and Jon, and to somewhat lesser extent Arya and Sansa, they are also portrayed as rather flawed, complex and contradictory figures, that chase and grow over time. For me the high point of the show was episode 10 of season 6, with the aftermath of Cersei's trial. If the show had ended then, I would have gave it 10/10. The 7-th season was still watchable and entertaining but the quality of writing clearly went down. While the pace of the action picked up, somehow it also felt more perfunctory and it became harder to care. Nothing like the episode \"The Door\" in this season. And the of course comes season 8. As many other reviewers noted, a complete and utter disaster. The writing completely collapsed, cartoonishly so, and the storyline became nonsensical and full of holes. A good final episode might have still saved the season and the series but instead we were handed a cruel and disgusting joke. For much of the duration of the series the show's creators prided themselves on unexpected plot twists and staying ahead of the audience, keeping it guessing. But that cannot be the point of the grand finale of the magnum epic like GOT. Here you have to deliver the expected. The most predictable and the most satisfying moment in the final episode was the \"Clegane bowl\". And I have not heard anyone complain about it. But you cannot build up the audience's emotional investment in the fate of the main character over the period of 8 years and then suddenly turn her form a queen-to-be into a raving mass murderer and kill her off. And on top of that discard the second most important character in the series as an unimportant afterthought. That's a complete betrayal of the loyalties of the audience of the series and it made it impossible to rewatch the show for most people. A great pity, really, since many of the early episodes are true masterpieces.

By far the best series I have ever seen in my life.\nI am basically a fan of movies and series based on books, although they often differ greatly from the actual content. This is not the case with this series at all.\nUntil season 7, the series follows Geroge R. R. Martin almost in perfection, but you don't get the impression that the actors read something from a piece of paper. Every actor shows performances and lets you feel emotions, I have never seen in a movie or series before.\nBecause of the higher number of main characters it is incredibly exciting until the very last episode. There is not just one character that you are excited about and that you love, there are thirteen (main characters).\nThere is no clear separation between black and white, between good and evil, there is no hero without flaw. You think and feel with each of these characters, and George R. R. Martin always manages to change your mind about a character on which you have already formed an opinion. A good example is Theon Greyjoy:\nI went from not caring about Theon,\nTo hating Theon,\nTo being disgusted by Theon,\nTo feeling sad for Theon,\nTo rooting for Theon,\nTo being Proud of Theon,\nTo wanting to follow Theon into battle.\nTHAT is how to write a character. Utter brillance, George R. R. Martin!\nNevertheless, for me the most important thing in a film and especially in a series is the story. Again, I must say that I have never seen such a precise, well-written, exciting, gripping, detailed, thoughtful, dynamic and emotional story. For those who don't know, the story is set in a fictional world and takes place on the continents of Westeros and Essos. The seven kingdoms of Westeros resemble the European Middle Ages and are shielded by a huge wall of ice from an area of eternal winter in the north. Spring, summer, autumn and winter can last for several years or even decades, their length is variable and unpredictable. The story begins at the end of a long summer and is initially told in three storylines, largely parallel to each other. Tensions build up between the powerful noble houses of the empire, which eventually lead to an open fight for the throne. Winter is coming, and a danger from a foreign power is looming in the far north of Westeros, where the Night Watch at the Wall is supposed to protect the kingdoms. In Essos, Daenerys Targaryen, heiress of the royal family of Westeros, which was deposed years ago, is striving to regain power.\nThe insanely complex story deals primarily with politics and power struggles, social relations, wars and religions.\nThe book is written in a demanding but not incomprehensible way, what is a very great art.\nSince David Benioff and D. B. Weiss follow the book for the most part, the series has the great effect that you put on headphones, the light dims, and you are no longer at home, you are at Winterfell or King's Landing.\nNo other series has made me feel this as much as Game of Thrones. Compared to other fantasy stories, like The Lord of Rings, The Witcher, or The Chronicles of Narnia, Game of Thrones is packed with breathtaking special effects, incredibly emotional and multi-faceted dialogues, gorgeous costumes, and funny sayings.\nA wonderful addition from HBO is the music in the series. It is better than anything before. Even movies like Interstellar, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean or Gladiator can still learn something from Game of Thrones' music.\nThe only deficit in the series is season 8, which destroyed my desire to rewatch Game of Thrones.", "review_date": "6 September 2020", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "chilledcookey", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur101989281/", "data-review-id": "rw5341760", "short_review": "For old times sake", "full_review": "", "review_date": "21 December 2019", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "aaronbowker", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur105261108/", "data-review-id": "rw5180512", "short_review": "Ending wasn't great", "full_review": "Was amazing until the last season where things became abit rushed", "review_date": "11 October 2019", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "rohitcoolboy", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur63851107/", "data-review-id": "rw5000236", "short_review": "Season 8 killed the entire show", "full_review": "I have watched GOT 3 times before season 8 premiered.

They went for straight shock factor and that's what they got a whole lot of fans shocked at how perhaps the greatest show ever ended up being the biggest disappointment ever.

The directing, cinematography, acting, music and writing (minus season 8) is all top notch. This series had an unbelievable first 6 seasons, season 7 felt like a step down but was still extremely interesting thanks to the interactions of Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow however season 8 is where the show falters, the final 3 episodes take at least 2 seasons of content and try to cram it into 3 episodes and the show suffers because of it. Contrary to what some might say I believe the ending actually makes perfect sense however the problem is how they get there, the story should've been given more time to develop to the end.

I mean the guilty just have to be punished for their crimes and for their reluctance to follow the right queen.\nIt's a great depiction of every totalitarian regime that blighted the 20th century. It's as Thyrion describes it in his cell in the final episode. He believed in her and that what she was doing was good, untill it became apparent that she was mesmerized by her own righteusness to believe that whatever she did was good, despite any objective proof that says otherwise. And John Snows betrayal of his beloved queen showed how difficult it is to stand up for what is right and admit that one has been wrong and mislead by a crazy movement; including how costly it is to leave that movement to people that do. Such people often loose everything but their freedome.\nSo the whole story is an extravagant reminder to not follow an ideology blindly, just because it promises freedome and justice at the start.

Watching these episodes week after week, year after year, were such an unforgettable experience. Such a treat. They managed to have it all - characters, world building, acting, costumes, effects, storytelling, music - all of it is freaking amazing. I don't even know how else I could describe it. It's a beautiful show. There has never been a TV show that captivated an entire country quite like GoT did.\nAs corny as it may sound, I am grateful to have been alive to watch it unfold, to watch the stories progress without knowing the fate of the characters on screen. I went to bed on Sundays feeling some type of way based on the episode they gave us. You couldn't binge an entire season in a month. You had to wait a week or a year to find out if your favorite character will still be around. That suspension added a lot of depth to the show. You guys watching now for the first time will never understand!\nLike everyone else says, the ending is a let down. If you're reading these reviews, you're already aware. TBH there was no way the writers could end this show and actually please their collective audience. I did not care for it whatsoever and much of the final season is just not up to par.

I've literally read everything written or sanctioned by GRRM on A Song of Ice and Fire and was not disappointed in any aspect of this TV show. IMO, it is the most amazingly excellent show ever made. The only reason I can think that people don't like it is 1) people tend to be lemmings and are influenced by people who are often stupider than they are so they let their opinions become poisoned by others and simply jump on the bandwagon when others say they don't like it 2) misunderstanding or lack of thoughtful consideration of the characters, themes, and plots of the entire series 3) irrational misperception that the fewer number of episodes in the last 2 seasons meant the writers and producers were paying short shrift to the story which is clearly not the case when you consider the episode lengths, the predicted number of total episodes from the outset, and the fact that there was resolution to all major plot lines and characters that remained true to the character's story arcs and nature. If they were to investigate, those who say the season was rushed would learn that there was only suppose to be a season 7 with 13 episodes, but with the enormously ambitious scale of these last 2 seasons, the producers were forced to break it into 2 seasons with fewer episodes per season (although these were exceptionally long episodes so the total time was nearly the same. This was done to allow time for post production without the need for an even longer break between seasons. From the outset they planes for about episodes/hours to tell this story. Guess how many episodes hours there were: 73, some of which were well over an hour. They also began planning seasons 7 and 8, 5 years before they aired so I have yet to see how the argument that they rushed season 8 holds any water. The scale of S8Ep3 was so great that it alone required 18 months of work and years of planning. To even suggest that the team \"phoned it in\" is absurd and demonstrates the ignorance of the person making that assertion. S8Ep3, The Long Night was layered, complex, a technical miracle, absolutely grueling for the writers, director, producers, and cast and crew, not to mention it's one the single most expensive episodes of TV ever produced and contained the largest and longest battle sequence ever filmed for TV or movies. The writing and editing expertly concealed the direction of the plot, contained several unexpected twists, killed off several beloved characters, and kept the viewer on the edge of their seats. And despite the incredibly length of the battle, they kept it fresh by not dragging out fight scenes, brilliant editing and story sequencing that allowed them to switch between characters and subplots to avoid viewer fatigue. That episode is the embodiment of the word \"epic\" and I defy any intelligent and informed person to successfully defend the argument that season 8 and especially episode 3 are anything less than ground-breaking and incomparable television. Like I said, I have yet to meet anyone in person or read anything online that makes a cogent argument against it.", "review_date": "7 December 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "johnphilps", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur103802184/", "data-review-id": "rw4906417", "short_review": "Mixed review for a mixed up series", "full_review": "", "review_date": "2 June 2019", "rating_value": "5"}, {"reviewer_name": "mornidorni", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur103141686/", "data-review-id": "rw4881026", "short_review": "The real GoT ended after season 6 for me", "full_review": "Because it was honestly the best show ,exciting/thrilling and just awesome.

But after watching Season 8 my expectations, everything were ruined. \"Why they( the makers) ended it like that?\"..this is the question that haunted me for few days. The way they want to show Dany as a villian is not convincing at all. They forcibly showed that. Another thing is that what is use of revealing Jon Snow as Aegon...While watching that particular episode(which tells secret about jon) everyone got goosebumps..and starts imagine him as a Future ruler...and at the same time the makers starts leaving small negative impressions of Dany...but throughout the seasons she showed like a good person , all she wants is a better world which can be created by her...but the way the makers showed that she felt fear that she can't get the throne as Jon is the true heir is a not convincing.....leave about that...She can have fear that she can't get the throne ...but in that situation also many of us thought that later she will be convinced to Jon as the king and she as the queen (becoz she loves jon and jon also loves her ) so the makers can create that situation in a clean way...if this also can't happen....they should have to give more time to convince that Dany shoul kill the kingslanding people ruthlessly. The way Dany killed the redkeep people is not convincing.And at the same time \"everyone wants Cersie to be executed by the Arya Stark in presence of Sansa,jon and Kingslanding people for what she had done to Sansa and her family\"..but that thing also didn't happen..Instead they ended Cersie in a simple unpredictable way. There are many like this. As Jon is not the king,Dany is not the queen,Cersie is not killed by Arya in front of Sansa...we may not say it is bad one...Still it is the best one in anyway..but with a soooooo bad ending...if the ending is in a proper way..it is worth watch for million times ,I can say that surely....but Now ,everytime I saw from the beginning..I am thinking that all this will fell into ashes in the end....if possible...in the name of other version of season 8 releases , it will be better...becoz it is not that great ending for a great series of all time..Thank u", "review_date": "9 September 2020", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "Harrison72", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur27459594/", "data-review-id": "rw6010985", "short_review": "Fantastic", "full_review": "Fantastic series.

I think almost everyone knows something about this series. In my opinion this series is good but a bit of overrated. The plot of this series is not that much attractive for me as I don't like violence that much. But overall the plot was beatiful. I found the series to be somewhat boring in the beginning and I started enjoying the series from season 4. There are some interesting storyline that had really low amount of screenplay like the story of the faceless man. The graphical work of this series is really praiseworthy.\nHowever, I found the story has slow build up and lack of character build up. There were many unnecessary characters and their stories which had too much screenplay time but not that much significant contribution to the story. The fighting scenes and use of new tactics made the war scenes so much interesting. From this series I came to know how brutal people were before. Adult scenes were too much in my opinion here. And the fun part about the story is the main throne had not that much of power or advantage rather it was a fight of houses. Overall I must say I liked the series so much but I am not mad about it.\nPersonal Rating - 8.5/9\n(Best time to watch it during Corona)", "review_date": "31 July 2020", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "ryanbcapote", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur63740256/", "data-review-id": "rw5732829", "short_review": "A rating for every season:", "full_review": "Season 1: 10/10\nSeason 2: 10/10\nSeason 3: 9/10\nSeason 4: 9/10\nSeason 5: 8/10\nSeason 6: 7/10\nSeason 7: 7/10\nSeason 8: 5/10", "review_date": "13 May 2020", "rating_value": "8"}, {"reviewer_name": "HarCarmichael", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur21288693/", "data-review-id": "rw5490369", "short_review": "Very Good Show", "full_review": "", "review_date": "17 February 2020", "rating_value": "8"}, {"reviewer_name": "deanfsimon", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur80392394/", "data-review-id": "rw5485748", "short_review": "Game of Thrones", "full_review": "One of the best shows ive ever watched .

I was convinced that after \"The Rains of Castamere\", \"The Mountain and the Viper\", and \"Hardhome,\" that GOT was able to give BB a true run for its money. Then came the episode in Season 6, \"The Battle of the Ba*t**ds\"---and I realized that Breaking Bad was dethroned. Even after a weaker Season 7, I had the feeling that GOT had it in the bag as best drama ever made. Then came Season 8, and I realized that GOT became different somehow. It very rapidly began losing its quality and its well earned place atop television's own \"Iron Throne.\" Breaking Bad retook its place on that throne, and the gap widened with each episode of the 8th season. It literally crashed harder and faster than Greg Norman on the final day of The Masters, or Jim Kelly or Dan Marino in a Super Bowl. I finally decided to lower my vote to 7/10. That is a C minus. That's the best I can honestly do. With the decimation of the series by the atrocious 8th season, that's really all it deserves. This is what is sometimes referred to as \"Scr**wing the Pooch.\" Imagine if Rocky ended during the final boxing scene with Rocky Balboa just stopping during the fight and he began to literally scr** a pooch. It would seriously leave the viewer with an incredulous puzzled sickening moment and affect one viscerally and disturbingly.

My opinion is that this is the best TV show or film ever filmed, indeed I think that nothing in the future is going to be better than GoT.\nOn the other hand I can understand why the fans aren't satisfied with the end of it (last season, or maybe two for some people). Producers shortened the show and fans were waiting for almost two years to watch the show grand final, but they didn't get what they were expecting to get. After the last episode I was angry also, but I decided to wait...and now I can tell that the GoT is more than 10/10. I can't understand how someone can rate low this show? What is with you people, did you watch every season, every episode? I don't expect that everybody is going to like the show like I do, but please think about every little thing (actors, costumes, effects, all the people behind the show...) before you rate the show. You people can't give 1/10 just because you didn't like the way it ends...\nLast thing, I'm living in one of the cities in which the GoT was filmed so believe me, I know how global and popular the show really is. Imagine thousands, maybe milions knowing about your city just beacuse of the Game of Thrones.", "review_date": "8 August 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "Nivar_Creed", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur54404149/", "data-review-id": "rw4878645", "short_review": "Magnificent show with Terrible ending", "full_review": "I'm not going to write spoilers here.\nI watched this show since season 1 was still on air.

Everyone involved in the show for this season should absolutely be proud of their amazing work... Except the script writers. Who were bad at their jobs.\nUnfortunately, no matter how well made and acted a show is (and it was brilliantly made and acted) if it's in service of an incompetently written script, then the writers do a disservice to everyone else. And the writers truly let down the show by not letting someone competent do the writing.\nThe last season of the show just seemed to be written by lazy writers who just wanted to finish up so they could go ruin Star Wars.\nI left it as an 8/10, down from the 10/10 it used to be, because every aspect of the show was fantastic, and it was only let down by the writing after there was no more source material to adapt.\nPlus, hasn't Cersei being pregnant (and it was confirmed in interviews with the show runners that she was) been a thing to try and humanise her for like a year and a half in the show's chronology? She's not even showing yet.\nAlternatively, if she was only a month or two along and everything in between took place in a month or two, then horses and ships and walking in Westeros must be REALLY fast, and the characters age REALLY fast, considering the amount of travelling that took place between the pregnancy being announced and the end of the show.\nEspecially considering Jamie went from Kings Landing (where the impregnating happened) to High Garden (I think he went there after, but it was a while ago so that might be wrong) to Kings Landing to Winterfell, fought in a war, moved in with Ser Brienne of Tarth, a time jump where they were serious (I think, it wasn't clear), and back to Kings Landing before Cersei had a baby bump.", "review_date": "26 May 2019", "rating_value": "8"}, {"reviewer_name": "deandeluca", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur64436494/", "data-review-id": "rw4884703", "short_review": "What a send off.", "full_review": "I've watched this show from day dot.

But I find Game of Thrones to be the most pretentious, sadistic, boring and perverted show on earth. First off, its medieval setting is incredibly clich\u00e9. Why do all fantasy things seem to take place in what resembles medieval Europe? This has been WAY overdone in the genre. And then there's the cruelty in the show. I love horror films, I love crime thrillers, but in Game of Thrones the frequent violence is so nonchalant that it's like a sociopath created a television program or something! Of course the rise of nerd culture is likely what is making this bizarre show so popular. All it is though is violence, boring archaic dialogue and of course, sex constantly. Sex without love, basically S/M porn for TV. Some viewers probably get off on it. It's disgusting, like watching a snuff film broadcast into my house. I no longer watch the show and have no plans to continue wasting my time with it. People praise it for its \"political concepts\" and \"well-developed characters\" and yet the show follows every fantasy trope and its only edge is death and violent sex for shock value. The whole show seems to exist largely just so its creators can push boundaries by throwing in all kinds of psychotic garbage just to see if they can pull it off and get away with it all.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Was it really as simple as a faceless man sneaking up on him to end it all?

Even in Chinese movies the tragedy has some deepness, there is honor, sacrifice, values, and death has purpose, in this one if something resembles to anything, one can be certain it is just a vessel for surprising the viewer with another unexpected random death. A pattern emerged and after 5 seasons any hope for a decent story is long dead. The worst part is millions of people are disturbed by the story but they keep looking for the hope it will get better. It never will. When people wait starts to obviously become annoying the author just kills the main character, does not matter how, and this way makes the story unexpected, again.

Maybe it sounds a bit more attractive, yes, but it's not the title it should bear. The most annoying thing about it all is that the characters are much much OLDER than they actually should be, twice the age and also not captured well. E.g. Joffrey Baratheon has become one of the most hated characters, but if you read the books, you may know there ARE equally vile characters in the story, if not worse. He shouldn't be more than 13, but in the series it is a 23 year-old lad who portrays him. Daenerys should be 15, yet in the series she is a 30 year-old woman. And so can I go on and on. Sean Bean as Eddard Stark? Really? He would be my last choice and Arya was supposed to be skinny... Second, why so much nudity and sex? I do not claim that in the books there isn't mentioned how characters are having sex, but it gets lost among thousands of other more important and interesting and more described adventures, and it's purpose is just to make a background and show us the nature of some of the characters. The books are NOT about brothels, the word \"brothel\" is just mentioned. All I want to say - if you read the books, why should you spoil your imagination by watching this? Let yourself immerse in the great prose of George R. R. Martin and let the series for those who prefer watching this horribly made adaptation over reading and letting their imagination free. My only question is how could Martin consent to such an adaptation of his fantastic books?", "review_date": "10 August 2015", "rating_value": "1"}]}, {"ImdbId": "tt0944947", "reviews": [{"reviewer_name": "BeatleFloydZeppelin", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur33077048/", "data-review-id": "rw2848863", "short_review": "Easily The Greatest Fantasy Television Show Ever, And Better Than Most Fantasy Films.", "full_review": "", "review_date": "10 August 2013", "rating_value": "8"}, {"reviewer_name": "saad-ahmed-personal", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur28794799/", "data-review-id": "rw2580597", "short_review": "Game of thrones", "full_review": "", "review_date": "13 March 2012", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "guy-schellens-41-715308", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur25965698/", "data-review-id": "rw2421834", "short_review": "Superb", "full_review": "", "review_date": "30 April 2011", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "CommonSenseIntelligence", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur7994415/", "data-review-id": "rw3453902", "short_review": "DEAD SERIOUS BLOODY human flesh skewered, NAKED FEMALES PIERCED, organs, maggots, breasts (oh great plot craft too)", "full_review": "", "review_date": "18 April 2016", "rating_value": "1"}, {"reviewer_name": "ricy2019", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur103301328/", "data-review-id": "rw4877954", "short_review": "Garbage Ending", "full_review": "Really...!!!???

Critics should be embarrassed for praising Game of Thrones. No reviewer is that stupid. This show has too many problems to be praised. I personally think that the showrunners simply bribed the critics into giving the show a positive review. No reviewer would ever give a 9.5 average rating on IMDb for this sh@t. Unless he was bought.

All GoT has going for it is sex and violence. The success of Game of Thrones is attributed largely to the plebes' lack of taste. This show is made to entertain plebes.

Also, knowing what's going on in the series helped me understand what is going on in the book. It's very detailed, in an almost Jane Austin kind of way and uses words we don't use in modern time, not to mention, a lot of character names that aren't very modern, so it takes a bit of thinking in the beginning to catch up and understand what is going on. But you get used to it pretty quickly and then it just flows. I would highly recommend this for anyone.

This is a brilliant adaptation of what is for me the best fantasy read I have ever had. Whilst some of the negative reviews have mentioned the vast array of characters and events in only the first few episodes, I on the other hand am amazed at just how well the massive amount of characters and descriptions have managed to be so well filtered or captured for TV. This is a massive undertaking and as someone who has read the book it is very difficult to judge just how understandable the plot is thus far if you haven't. This a tale of the human trait of tribalism, loyalty and betrayal set in the magical world created by a great author where seven kingdoms lie in constant fear of the evil that winter may bring and Winter is Coming. To understand the plot is to move in stealth from one land to another, one clan to another, one bed to another, weaving a thread that creates the patchwork of this intricate yet barbarically woven material. What I can say, is do not worry yourself too much about understanding who, what and where each character fits in, just watch it. You will become familiar with them as the story unfolds. That said, for those who have read the books, the series has had a lot to live up to and that is its biggest test, passed so far as far as this reader/watcher is concerned. I'm hooked, again and I'm loving it. The acting is readily acceptable if not very good and whilst I was anxious about the selection, I feel so far that every actor chosen has physically fit the character described in the book very well with the possible exception of Catelyn Stark played by Michelle Fairley (who should have been a little better looking) and John Snow played by Kit Harrington (although I can't quite put my finger on why). The detestable Tyrion Lannister, my favourite character, played brilliantly by Peter Drinklage is just perfect and as for Arya Stark (Maisie Williams), well they stole her right out of my imagination.

What is missing from GOT is any semblance of humanity. I can count on one hand the number of decent characters still living (Danerys and her General, Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, John Snow, and the two small Stark boys whose names escape me.) Yes, there are a few more decent folks here and there, but they get very little air time and have no influence on the story. The rest are either corrupt, despicable or just plain EVIL.

No one really loves anyone in GOT, or if they did, you can be sure somebody died horribly because of it.

Then I found myself with a lot of dead time at a job once and ploughed through the first 3 series thanks to the blessing of fast forwarding. So yes, the production is epic and the scenery stunning and some characters are worth following.But the plot devices are so clumsy it is painful! The main beef I have is with the military campaigns that eat up hours of the story but NEVER comes to fruition. Instead they peter out in one quick assassination or a quick battle and the whole thing is forgotten. We then follow another campaign for hours that ends up in a dead end with no advancement to the story at all. Also there is way too much sex and sadism, but apparently people like that in their series. I'm not anti-sex, I just like the plots of adventure movies to get out of the bedroom from time to time, although that has slowly been phased out through seasons 4 and 5. The concept is great and as I said the production value is amazing but there is no satisfaction to be had at any point. For me story telling is about watching heroes (sometimes flawed ones), overcome odds to achieve something that changes things for the better at some point. But there is little of that if none at all. All we get is series of overlong cat-fights, doomed campaigns and pointless travels that achieve nothing in terms of viewer satisfaction. Killing off main character is all well and good as a shock tactic but it looses its impact if it happens every 2 minutes and we are left with no-one to root for, and then what's the point of watching. Then it just becomes cinematic masturbation of seeing how depraved people can be and how grand the scenery can be.

Show started strong and the at the end of 1st season I was really angry when they killed NED like they did!! But it was OK I mean I was waiting to see some pay back as they(Wolf and company) were no sheep, Wolf will hit back somehow. Following season was some more disappointment in terms of my aspirations lol(Robb dead and others in following season -Oberyn, stannis etc). Well still there were some sparks that made me feel that there is still some hope and things will change but NO!!! There are so many reasons people liked the show at First but then the way it is going I really don't want to watch that. Bran and Arya Stark is left who are very young and Sansa I hate that girl lol, I wish they killed her instead!! Tyrion is a very good and interesting character who is left other than Starks. But rest all i was rooting for are dead. Not that its anybody's fault or am blaming them for anything but I don't want to watch a TV show and get angry every time at the end of every season and wait to get furthermore disappointment. Only few things to enjoy and many things to annoy is the crux of this Series!!! I don't care about that Dragon born girl Dany, or other lannisters, or Tyrells and other such kind of houses. Devious and cheaters do win but not all the time! SO something is wrong here. It has tuned into those kind of shows which are so sad all the time and joyful rarely. I am not a hater but they took my joy away and I really don't like Game of Thrones now. Am not here to watch cersie and Tyrells playing house, or Bolton Bastard doing tortures and stuff. Dumb night watcher killing Jon snow. Its so sad every time this series progresses. Some people might like that kind of stuff but I will rather play counter strike or Football or listen music.

I just finished watching Episode 2. I find the actors to be nearly perfectly suited for the book's characters. The book is rather slow, with a lot of character complexity and social intrigue. The television series adapts this very well by presenting the most poignant moments from the book, the ones that capture the essence of a character or the mood of a scene. My wife does not like fantasy, but she is completely captivated by this series. The story is more true to the many shades of human nature than, say, \"Lord of the Rings\" or other popular fantasy fare. Therefore it transcends the limits of its genre and will appeal to fantasy aficionados and non-geeks alike. It is also dark, raw, and realistic. Therefore trees don't whistle tunes and good guys don't always end up on top. As a fan of the books, based on the first two episodes alone, I believe that HBO has done an outstanding job of adapting George R.R. Martin's \"Game of Thrones\" to television.

Enjoyed the slowly increasing supernatural elements like Lady Melisandre's magic, the horrible walking dead and, of course, the dragons. The last two episodes were action-packed and left me yearning for the next season. Now I'm watching the 3rd season only one day behind the original showings in the US and I must say that it is breath-taking! The action, the characters, the pure evilness of the characters, the fantastic elements, the effects and settings.. the sinister dialogs (especially Tywin's \"heart-warming\" moments with his children Tyrion and Cersei), ahhhh, this is something never seen on TV.

Seasons 1 - 6 were, what I like to call, perfection. The story telling and character development was all there. The world the writers built was amazing and understandable as they were basing themselves on the amazing work of GRRM. Then the incompetent \"writers\" David Benioff and Dan Weiss ran out of source material and it all went down hill. Season 7 started by having our one and True Dragon Queen return to her home. Westeros. The problem with that was the Tyrion Lannister became an inept as hand of the queen. One of the most spectacular characters in tv history became the stupidest strategist in all Westeros. As the season went on we had more and more stupid dialog. We had the Stark sisters pinned against each other. I'm sorry, did the writers not now that the one thing Starks love more than anything is their family and pinning the sisters against each other was just so stupid and the storytelling was not there. Then, we have to talk about that horrific episode 6. Beyond the wall. Well beyond the wall is were you will find plot armor for most of the characters and an ice zombie that played all of these dummies just to get himself a bran new dead Dragon. The fact that these writers thought that bringing a WW to Kings Landing to prove to Cersei that the dead were coming just shows us all how bad Dan and David were not able to interpret GRRM work and bring it to the tv screen. Now we move on to the last season. Deep down in my soul I wanted to believe that the writers were going to give us something. Build on all the theories and story lines GRRM created, but we just got more crappy make no sense writing. Lets start by the Long Night that lasted not that long. CMON! The Night King was killed by miss Arya Stark. How? Why? We had all this build up of Jon and the Night King finally battling each other. And also what was up with all the plot armor? Jon should've died. Sam should've died. Arya should've died. So many more main characters were put in such life threatening situations that they should have died. Then we move on to the last 3 episodes. So, Ms. Cersei now avidly people watches from her window. This amazing character was ruined. She did nothing and ended up dead at the bottom of the Red Keep, crushed by bricks. Clegane bowl, in my opinion, was stupid and way over rated. Arya surviving the attack on kings landing was, yet again, more plot armor. Finally, Daenerys Targaryen. Such a powerful female character tarnished by two so called writers. At the end of the day GOT will forever be one of my favorite shows, but I will never forget how it was ruined by two incompetent writers that by subverting expectations ended up ruining the greatest show in Tv history.", "review_date": "20 November 2020", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "mike_bismillah", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur84776771/", "data-review-id": "rw6020972", "short_review": "best of the best", "full_review": "What else do u want in a tv show. very well executed in all aspects", "review_date": "23 August 2020", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "farasmuhd", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur114842058/", "data-review-id": "rw5557914", "short_review": "One of the astonishing season ever.

Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" book series, is a masterful television production, which utilizes the complex plot and characters to their fullest potential.\n You never really know who's gonna make it after you settle in during the first few episodes and understand what's even happening. Once you have an idea what the plot is about, you can't really stop thinking about it. So many characters, each with their own motivations and mysterious plots- you just can't help but be pulled into it all, not fully knowing who you like most and who you can't stand. The characters are among the best in the history of literature, and are all dynamic and come alive on the screen.\n The conventional filmmaking is also top quality, as is expected from a top tier production. There are no foul editing mistakes, bad acting sequences or truly questionable motivations- it is all quite perfectly done.\n The main point that this show proves (not concerning the plot), is that the setting, in this case a medieval fantasy world, should not determine what the viewer should expect from it. As much as I would personally enjoy a well done, typical fantasy show with fantasy tropes, this is not it.

As you can tell i am not one of you. Game of Thrones has so many good reviews & such glowing praise as to make me wonder if the whole world has fallen asleep or alternatively hooked up to some matrix-like hive mind channelling this drivel through a tube placed carefully up your backside, can so many people be so wrong? well the answer is Yes obviously. To Critique this show in a sour way is tantamount to treason i am sure but i am British & trust me it is OK to voice your opinion in a negative way despite the whole world wanting to spit venomous bile in your eyes. I have like most of you, watched every episode of it & although you will rant that i have a choice not to watch it or to plainly just go away, i, like a lot of people these days like watching TV shows & be they bad or good it is always good to watch the things that everyone is talking about (and talking about, and talking about) so i carry on in the vain hope that one day i'll switch this show on & something will actually happen but instead i get B grade British actors talking about 'The Wall' or saying things like 'Something awful is coming' or 'Let's shag!' & on & on, talking, more talking & waiting & waiting, always waiting for something to happen, has anyone noticed that nothing has happened in this show for the last 2 seasons? oh but there was a big battle! yes there was except we missed most of it as we were watching the women hiding below talking some more. Oh but there was 'The Wedding' yes there was, 5 minutes of action tabbed on the end of one of those lengthy talky episodes (you know the ones) 'wow so radical, killing off some of the main characters in such a ghastly manner, no one has done that before' Give me strength!! Game of thrones is like a really bad carrot, like the ones you always throw away to get a better one in the grocers, and the viewers are like ageing donkeys continually following it around until you are so accustomed to doing it that you just carry on regardless, yes i am one of them, i've been suckered as well!, i admit it but by always tossing out the promise of dragons i persevered anyway & now i am at a point that i am writing a review about it, not because i like the bloody thing more because i am sick of these endless reviews praising it's 'Boldness', it's 'Genius', it's 'Lord of the Rings-ish-ness.' My god people, what version of Lord of the Rings have you seen? the one i watched was majestic, action packed, sad, uplifting, funny & the real definition of Genius. Not this pile of puss spewing troll bile that passes itself off as fantasy, if anything its more like playboy channel soft core porn than epic fantasy, obviously one of the main reasons its so popular. Of course you will tell your girlfriend/boyfriend your watching it for the breathtaking dramatics or epic storytelling (because of course it has both of those..cough..choke!!) So you will go on watching it telling your friends how amazing it is, how shocked you were by it etc etc but deep down you all know the truth, that this is just a low level generic hybrid of The Red Shoe Diaries, Dr Quinn Medicine Woman & the recent crap Conan movie. In years to come this will be joked about, like in one of those TV Shows that reminisce about the 80's or 90's with a headline like 'How 10 million people COULD be wrong' & you'll sit there & laugh to yourself in a sad 'i wasted my youth' type way, you will finally realise after years of trailing after the carrot that nothing is going to happen in this show, you'll be left with one last talky exposition scene (whilst a battle rages on somewhere else, presumably somewhere they can't take the cameras) everybody will sit round the throne & toast with fine wine & grapes, there will be singing & dancing & orgies (of course) and maybe if we are lucky, one of the dragons might take a dump? Seriously if people don't start waking up soon i worry about the world, i mean Reeves & Fishburne are way too famous now to give a toss so save yourselves. There are much better shows out there to obsess over, much better fantasy books to read, much much better fantasy films to watch & certainly way better porn! but of course if watching evil characters twirl their moustaches & cackling behind peoples backs whilst masturbating over incestuous kin doing the Humpty Dumpty is your kind of thing, there is at least one scene like this every couple of episodes so knock yourself out. oh and of course you will get the promise of dragons just at the moment your thinking about switching off & watching re-runs of Breaking Bad instead... awful TV, watch Lord of the Rings again, that might wake you up my Matrix loving friends. Game of Thrones, enjoy your stay of execution but one day your head is going to be lopped off just like the only good actor in your show...

They call it a success! I don't know how to assess success for a TV show at the time of illegal torrent downloads. Yes, it was very successful in luring more illegal downloads than any other show in history and I assume it happened because of the high price of HBO as premium cable channels and its exclusive and somehow restricted broadcast through very limited channels. Forbidden fruit is always exiting even if its apple, a fruit which is anything but exiting in reality! Game of thrones is a nice show, it sure has very good production, character development is brilliant as there are no heroes and there are almost no pure villains. that's what I like about it. It's not black and white, its grey! but the screenplay lack the thrust. Episodes come and go and nothing really happens. It was like it from the very beginning, it never improved, just continued like a flat line. After watching couple of episodes, it downgraded to the level of well polished soap opera. I was on my laptop doing my work and it was on on TV. Each 2-3 hours i had to raise my head t see whats going on, I liked to know what happens at the end but the way to the end was so boring that I decided to make it tolerable with multi tasking.

The way that first hill makes you realize with dread that you are at the mercy of a beast; the plunge that follows, causing your insides to rise from your stomach to your throat; the countless twists and turns which momentarily lull you into a false sense of safety before jerking your body in a new direction; and, finally, when the ride is over and you struggle to regain your composure, staggering uncontrollably to return to reality's homeostasis.

My objections? Firstly the writing is terrible - characters speak in this strange and special 'fantasy genre' dialogue which is stiff and comic (when it's not supposed to be) - the series looks cheap and nasty too - sets are often clearly studio bound with weak design, poor lighting and a strangely dated feel - it looks like a 1970/80s BBC Shakespeare production a lot of the time. The series also takes itself far too seriously - the whole thing has a portentous quality and apparently fails utterly to recognise its own silliness.

A) While it has slowed down somewhat in season 5, the gratuitous nudity and violence is wholly unnecessary. In most cases, it is necessary to convey the brutality of the universe, however, a lot of times its done as a cheap way to shock the viewer. Did we really need that last scene of Lady Stark being gored on screen? A cut to black and slicing sound would have been fine, but they seem to want to spit on the good work they have done. And did we really need 8 minutes of the queen regent walking naked? B) There are many great characters...and while I don't like \"good always triumphs\", four of the five characters I have really been interested have died (Tyrion being the lone holdout). A lot of them dying just for the sake of shocking the viewer.

It stays within the story's boundaries given the limited time allowed for the series. Like the Lord of the Ring's, both film series are linear and tell the story, but both book series are more colorful with much more depth to the stories, more sidestories and character development than the time restrictions allow.

But i couldn't find a single main thing, maybe the occasional out of pace scene but nothing to distract you if this amazing journey. Let's start with the plot, it is an adaptation of the famous series of novels A Song of Ice and Fire from George R. R. Martin. Like you guessed I haven't read them but I'll congratulate George for such a deep and rich universe and characters! But you are gonna ask, can this show really pull you into this story and make you like the protagonists? The answer is: ABSOLUTELY! I found myself cheering for Tyrion as he led his forces in Blackwater Bay! I liked hating Joffrey's guts and seeing what other horrible things he could do! And I liked immersing myself in Jon Snow's journey to the mysterious and wild lands that lie North of the Wall! The story is so engaging and it never gets lost in the overwhelmingly big cast of characters. There were a few times where I said \"woah, who was this?\" or \"what was this dudes name?\", but nothing overly complicated. The actors are great, they are full of charm and fit the characters. The ones that really stood out where Peter Dinklage as the smart and cunning Tyrion Lannister, Sean Bean as the honorable and loyal Ned Stark and last but not least, Jack Gleeson, playing the and sometimes chilling Joffrey Baratheon!

I was afraid they may not follow the source material (like AMC did with \"The walking dead\") or that their depiction of certain events and people/creatures would suck) but I was pleasantly surprised. All of the cast members did a great job and most of them really fit the characters their were assigned. The production values are excellent, everything looks as if this were a big budget film, it really must have cost them a fortune to make this show. Except for a few (mostly minor) exceptions they were really true to the book and all of the major events were shown with as much detail as they were in the book. However there were some changes I didn't like. The biggest one is the age of the \"children\" (the Starks, Baratheons and Daenerys). Almost every single one (except maybe Arya) is way too old. Rob and Jon are 14 in the books. Here they look to be in their late teens or early twenties. The same goes for Daenerys, she is supposed to be 13, here she looks like 20. In her case it would be somewhat understandable since the producers were probably concerned about showing a 13 year old girl f*cking like she does, but in the case of the boys I see no valid reason for the change, and considering that the events in the books so far span a few years where you see the characters growing older the decision to cast older actors seems rather nearsighted. The biggest age difference is from Rickon (also known in the show as the invisible Stark :P). In the book he is about 2. Here he must be 6 or 7 at least. Another thing I didn't like were the scenes that weren't in the book, like the ones with The Spider and Littlefinger or the homo-erotic scene between Stannis and Loras Tyrell and the ones that are in the book but not in the show, namely the battles. There are only 2 battles in the first book but we only see their aftermath in the show (and in one of them an important fact -certain deaths- is not mentioned). I can understand that this may have been due to a time constraint (they were trying to fit the entire book in a mere 10 episodes) but if it was due to budget constraints one has to wonder what are they going to do in he following seasons? Books 3 to 4 (I haven't read 5 yet) have dozens of battles, some very large (including a naval battle), that are essential to the plot. If they choose to only show their aftermaths that will certainly detract from the show.", "review_date": "18 September 2011", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "jamestmoody", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur26834899/", "data-review-id": "rw2453151", "short_review": "Awesome!", "full_review": "This series will hook you in by the end of the first episode.

A 9.5 rating on IMDb is baffling, to be honest, as there are literally tens of thousands of titles that deserve a better rating than this series. Having watched the first several episodes of S1 and selected other episodes from various other seasons, I can confirm that this series really DOES NOT live up to its reputation. Not by a long way. Truthfully, I actually found it rather dull, and lacking anything of real interest. I'm convinced that about half of Game of Thrones's audience is most likely teenagers who simply watch due to the large amount of nudity/sex scenes, because that's really the most notable aspect of it, and that isn't even necessarily a positive factor. I've read some of the books by George RR Martin, and they were far more enjoyable than this, so if you want to know the Game of Thrones story, I strongly advise you to read the books rather than sit through 60 hours of this nonsense. It's nothing but a chore. But if you're looking for a TV series that could actually, realistically be considered a masterpiece, there are many other and let's face it, infinitely superior ones. Breaking Bad. True Detective. Lost. These are just several of the shows that I guarantee you would find far better than this, and they prove that Game of Thrones getting a 9.5 rating is, quite frankly, a joke. If you're thinking of watching it, please don't waste your time.

I was amazed of the story line. Episode after episode, season after season everything got better and better. The shocking element in the scenario became like a trade mark for G.R.R.Martin. But after the 6-th season I felt some stagnation on every level. The show became less emotional, less rational, less intriguing. In Season 7 the story passed ssooooo slowly, almost painfully slowly without anything special happening. Only the last 2 episodes was really valuable. Season 8 was the opposite - very rushed, full of plot holes, mistakes (including simple ones like mineral water bottles, coffee cups, ets). The remaining characters \"acquired\" plot armor, just like Batman :D. The 'realism' of the story faded. It is obvious that it was done without much enthusiasm. It was like \"Let's finish it as soon as possible\". I get it that D&D now have a big, greater project as \"Star Wars\" but this is not excuse. So my general rating for all the seasons is 7/10. Because the value of a story depends very much on the end of this story.

One of the biggest pop culture icons of all time. There probably isn't one human being who hasn't at least heard of it at some point. And for good reason. The first 4 seasons of Game of Thrones are flawless, beautiful compositions of jaw dropping cinematography, goosebump inducing music score, and masterful actors. The writing is truly great, with virtually every scene impacting the viewer in some way. The characters are beautifully established, with realistic and nuanced arcs. Realism is baked into this world, making Westeros uncomfortably familiar, and the murky, depressing, dark themes and plot lines only enhancing that effect. Then come the later seasons, 5, and 6. The writing is starting to show cracks, with characters changing without any real initiative, a lot of consequences and story lines diluted. However, these seasons, especially season 6, still have some of the best moments ever made for television, with characters to show for it. The Battle of the Bastards for example, is absolutely jaw dropping. And then the later seasons, which butcher pretty much everything and everyone. The female characters were mostly very unlikable to me, such as Arya, or Danerys, who really doesn't deserve the throne, but whatever. (Osha was awesome tho.) But characters like Jon Snow, Ned Stark, Jaime and Tyrion Lannister, shall forever be remembered.

I think I don't need to say how good Game of Thrones is. But DAMM this series is just incredibly good! I actually didn't read the books first. I have to say that when I saw the pilot I was a little bit sceptical about the series. I thought it was another one of those medieval series. But it didn't take me very long to realize that this series was different. First of all the quality of the series (music, filming, acting..) is really incredible, which is actually quite understandable when yu see their budget. One thing I really love on the series are the accents and the languages. They make the serie so enjoyable to watch and also ( now that I read the books) I can say that the way they talk is pretty similar to the books. Since I'm talking about the books: many series that are based on books are never as great as the original story and are critisized for cutting out a lot of important things and not keeping the same athmosphere. But I have to say that the producers did an amazing job on not disappointing the bookfans. The book and the series are equally good in my opinion. To end this I also wanted to point out how unpredictable GoT is. I think thats also what makes it so great and why we are al still thrilled after 7 seasons. In most Tv shows you can easily predict what happens but in GoT you rarely know who's going to survive the next episode. At least after the red wedding you realize you can't be attached to your favorite characters for too long... because you never know when they might die...!

There is another scene in the same episode in the same situation (a jousting tournament) where someone gets a joust stuck in their throat and they start vomiting blood. I hope this series gets stopped soon, it is absolutely disgusting and gut-wrenching. My peers and siblings seem to enjoy it because of the occasional sex scene.

Right, it is HBO, and there is nothing wrong with a bit of nudity and sex, but Jaysus, we have watched a few episodes now and the sex business is just there for no reason. No \"plot\" advancement. No explanation of character. Nothing. Just sex. Alright there is an incest scene but interestingly not graphic and this is the whole premise of the story. As I said we are about 6 or 7 episodes into this shyte, but the story is thin and as of yet we have not had the obligatory lesbian scene (HBO trademark, come to that every Network trademark).

I really like a few characters but the thing with George Martin (the author of the books) is that he kills off some of the characters you tend to love which makes you become emotionally attached to the series even more to see how those characters closest the dead one cope! Its like a web full of little links and thats what makes it unique. The storyline is fantastic. I love the fantasy and magical qualities it has. The filming, producing and editing is also fantastic. Its just AMAZING. I'm completely hooked and obsessed! Once you watch there's no turning back, you'll be hooked from start to end of every episode.

The casting is like plucking the imagery, that author Martin has so richly set, straight from my brain. Normally, with any book adaptations, the expectation of the characters and their core traits, both physically and emotionally, is a rare probability. HBO has absolutely nailed it. The acting is top notch, the set design pinnacle (pause your dvr sometime and notice the intricacies of the various elements within each set), and the script does exquisite justice to Martin's imagery. I can only anticipate the growing intricacies of the plot lines to come, and cannot wait to see each character develop as the story unfolds. I have thought for several years that no show could give me the rush of emotion and anxiety as I experienced watching \"Band of Brothers\", HBO has trumped themselves, and I believe have created the greatest production of a show ever to graced television.

So this review is coming from someone who hasn't read the book. The first thing I'm going to talk about is the acting. I see shows like the walking dead that are action filled and have a decent story-line, but unfortunately the acting is where it falls flat. Now, I'm not saying I don't like the walking dead; I am just stating that it would be a better show if the acting was to be improved. Fortunately, this acting annoyance doesn't occur in game of thrones. The makers of the show seem to be a lot less careless when deciding who to pick and they haven't seemed to make any mistakes when deciding big roles. Tyrion's trial scene In season four was one example of how good the acting is and it remains as my favourite scene throughout all seasons. Second of all, the story-line. I haven't read the books and so I couldn't comment on how they have changed the story-line from the books to the show, but what I can say, is that the show has a story-line that gets you to check how many minutes you've watched of each episode in hope there is still lots left to go. Sadly, time flies by when watching quality television and so the Game of thrones episodes feel way too short. Finally, I'm going to talk landscapes. Now I'm not sure where they film everything, but it makes you think it's on an entirely different planet when you see the stunning imagery. There are many more things I could point out in this show, but I'm running out of time. To summarise, this show is action filled, has a good story-line, has strong characters from both genders and the acting is perfect.", "review_date": "25 February 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "rockjaguar514", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur32978789/", "data-review-id": "rw2948746", "short_review": "Winter is Coming", "full_review": "HBO has really outdone themselves this time by ordering 'Game of Thrones'!

The writing, acting, directing, and effects are unbelievable. But a lot of main characters die very upsetting and shocking deaths. I recommend this show to anyone who loves violent dramas.

Game of thrones is an epic fantasy with an incredible character driven narrative and set against an epic backdrop of violence, nudity and sex. It's essentially a tale between 7 feuding families fighting for dominion over the mythical land of Westeros and the fascinating struggle for power that ensues. The plot is full of twists and turns that makes for a compelling drama, that is set in some of the most stunning locations witnessed on TV. Breathtaking location like the frozen fortress of the Nights Watch and the rats nest of a capital that is Kings Landing, provide the viewer with plenty of eye candy, whilst confirming this shows status as the most ambitious piece of work ever to grace TV. The production values and high quality script writing both contribute to the overall quality of the show, with quotes like \"Try to penetrate the enigma that is me\" and \"Winter is coming\" soon becoming common household phrases and typifying the quality of the people who work on the show. However it's the characters and actors who portray them, that make this show truly great. From the witty dwarf Tyrion Lannister played by the excellent Peter Dinklage, to the noble Ned Stark played by the legendary Sean Bean,to the feisty Daenerys Targaeryan played by the beautiful Emilia Clarke, thrones oozes quality in the character and acting department. Even some of the supposedly minor characters like the slippery informant Varys,the loudmouthed GreatJohn Umber, the mindless oaf Hodor and the infamous mercenary Bronn all manage to be intriguing in their own way, which highlights the vast array of unique characters thrones has. Thrones manages to keep the audience emotionally invested in its various characters, whether you are rooting for the honorable Ned or cursing at the scheming Lord Baelish,there is a character everyone can relate to. Overall thrones is a sophisticated adult fantasy that doesn't hold back, and HBO must be commended for their faithful adaptation of the a song of ice and fire series of books. The sheer gore and sexual activities encompassed in the series makes it a uniquely entertaining experience and not one for the feint hearted. Lord of the rings this certainly isn't, game of thrones reinvents the fantasy genre in a stylish sort of way, which is a credit to author George RR Martin and show runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss.", "review_date": "1 May 2012", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "freddy2961988", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur14211129/", "data-review-id": "rw2465305", "short_review": "Compares to the likes of movies like Gladiator and Robin Hood", "full_review": "Based on the bestselling fantasy book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R.

His fantasy novels develop from the relative rationality of characters to absolute irrationality of characters, including story lines and ambience. However, if one remembers Tolkien's Fantasy Universe, his Universe develops from irrationality to rationality (perfectly matched with the history of Renaissance). In the mid 20th century, one sees the peak of Sci-Fi literature. As a result of this, - we see the development in techniques and engineering resulting in the of creation bombs, and the discovery of new sources of energy and etc.). So, irrational realities became a focal point of literature, not only academic, but fictional as well. At the same time, TV series production brought a new wave of literature, revitalizing some literary traditions (also here is a good example of Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty).

Firstly, this show is a medieval fantasy-drama but it is unlike any other fantasy film or television series you have ever seen. The show is based on George R.R. Martin's acclaimed 'A Song of Ice and Fire' novel series and it is an outstanding adaption of these great books. In later seasons, the show manages to heavily deviate from the book's contents and have actually surpassed the book series, and many characters who are deceased in the show are still alive in the books but the show's writers and producers have all managed to pull this off with spellbinding results.\nWhat carries this brilliant show is its numerous, but remarkably strong storytelling which manages to bewitch the viewer on the very first episode. Many of the shows characters, are instantly memorable and lovable, even the villains. All of the acting is outstanding and many of the show's stars deserve all their awards and should receive casting roles for their fabulous work on thw show. The medieval scenery on the show is incredibly realistic and believable it manages to send the viewers back in time. The settings are beautiful and filmed with exquisite precision in some of the most stunning parts of the world. Furthermore, the special effects and CGI are film-worthy and is what really brings this magical show to life.\nI don't wish to spoil a single plot point but all intelligent viewers and lovers of fantasy fiction should watch this show. Everyone I know who has watched has become instantly addicted so be prepared to be blown away. It is definitely not overrated in the slightest and is very worthy of your time and consideration.

I never thought I would say this even though this show does get political sometimes (I never understood politics so there's no reason to be invested) but this is the most intriguing, shocking, heart pounding suspenseful, intense, hardcore, gut-wrenching dramatic, fantasy drama series I have ever witnesses in my entire life! I see why it trumps the Sopranos. I just adore how heavy and dark this show gets every time I watch it. It's a show about seven noble families battling their way to take the Throne in Westeros. It's slow at times but it's a long journey, it''s supposed to be slow. There's a lot of focus on the characters--which are a lot, by the way--but my favorites are Tyrion Lannister played by Peter Dinklage, Arya Stark played by Maisie Williams, and most of all the gorgeous mother of the dragons who steals the show, Daenerys Targaryen played by Emilia Clarke. There are other interesting characters but those three are my personal favorites. Tyrion is a dwarf but a very intelligent, smart-ass, Shakespearean member of the Lannister family, the most hated people in the entire show. He knows his family's a group of evil people and they are his family but he doesn't agree with their methods very much. He's the only Lannister in the family who's close to being almost good, regarding him as more of an antihero. Arya is a very young, strong, courageous child who is more of a fighter than a child and fights with her thin sword called the Needle, though she is still a learner, but brave nonetheless. It's so admirable that a child this young (probably 14) could be so daring and tough. And Daenerys is a girl (probably in her twenty's, she looks young) who becomes the mother of dragons--which, to the special effects' credit, look really impressive--and uses them to fulfill her goal: reclaim the Throne of Westeros. She's basically a conqueror with legitimate motivations which also makes her an antihero/hero. There really is no MAIN character which makes the show more intriguing, but those are my personal favorite characters of all time. I won't give too much, it's better if you go to www.cokeandpopcorn.ch and watch it. Aside from the fact that it get's political sometimes, there are other intriguing stories and characters that I think you would thoroughly enjoy.

So, enjoy the TV series which is very true to the books (except that most of the main characters are portrayed as being twice as old as they were written).

Too many sex scenes probably too boost up the ratings. Compared to the Pilars of the Earth (8 mini TV series), The game of Thrones is at least 3 \"steps\" lower.

Do you want to know why?", "full_review": "Even if you don't watch \"Game Of Thrones\" chances are you have probably a lot of friends who watch it and say that it is the best show that they have ever seen, and can't stop telling you about it. Well i say that too, because i haven't seen anything close to it. First of all i have watched many TV shows, both that now i consider good and bad, and when i say a lot i mean it (The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Arrow, Sherlock, House Of Cards, True Detective...). Now i stopped doing that, because i realized i was wasting a lot of time watching TV shows. The only TV shows that i now watch are Game Of Thrones and House Of Cards. I would say i have grown up a bit in 3 years, but i only see those TV shows worth spending my time on. Now that i have told you my backstory i can start praising Game Of Thrones, and saying how everything is perfect, except i WILL NOT do that. I will tell you what i think makes this show that good and why you should start watching it, but i will also focus a bit on the bad sides that there aren't many, but they have to be brought up in order for you to make a good judgement about it. If you are expecting a TV show just to spend your Friday or Monday night, entertaining yourself at the moment you won't get that with Game Of Thrones. What you will get instead \"Game Of Thrones\" is a big journey, full of carefully invented events and characters. The characters are psychologically well described, exactly like people in real life. Each one of the characters has his goals, motivations, morals and specific mindset (way of thinking) that the show presents it to you in the best way possible. If you wan't to understand it better, you should read something on reddit or rewatch the show, because a lot more is going on than what you have noticed. It's made in a way that if you think and analyze the decisions of the characters you will end up predicting how they will act in the future, like a game of chess. It has a lot of plot twists that you will never expect and that will definitely shock you while watching it. The most important thing that makes me love this show so much is how realistic it actually is. But wait you will ask yourself this is a fantasy show isn't it? Yes it is, because there is a world just for \"Game of Thrones\" , with specific history, geography, politics, holidays, and even the accents of characters who are from different places in Westeros are specific. It has even two languages made just for the show with around 1000-3000 words. You can see the realism in the show, just from it's motto that it is \"All men must die\", meaning that everything can happen in the show just like in real life. There is not a main character that beats all the odds and lives happily forever after. No every character in \"Game Of Thrones\" has it's good and bad sides, ups and downs, and most importantly everyone can die in any moment, there is not coincidences like in other movies or TV shows, where at the end the character will be saved by some miracle or a coincidence. The show doesn't have a hero, nor a villain, but it makes you decide for yourself who the hero is and who the villain is. What i think makes this show the best of them all is that it can be watched by any audience and still be enjoyed by everyone. Whether you are an intellectual and a very educated person or not very much educated (no offense to anyone), this show has something for everyone. Whether you are watching it for the dragons, the middle aged theme, the sexual scenes, or like me for the game of chess that's going on in it from the start, you fill find something that will hook you to it. I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT! What i would say that people don't like much about it, it's the start of the show. It takes some time to meet and get to know the characters, and when you start, you will not have much to go on, but when you finish the first few episodes it just won't leave your mind. I want to thank you for reading this rather big review, but i think you will find it very helpful considering my experience with TV shows. And yes, Game Of Thrones is really my number one favorite.

It's really no wonder why GoT is hailed as the most popular, most awarded and most critically acclaimed show ever. If you're not a fan of the fantasy genre, you might dismiss Thrones as Hobbit hype or '' fantasy crap' but you'd be wrong. It's in the HBO tradition of The Wire, The Sopranos, Deadwood and Westworld, a big-budget tour of a fictional world with its own moral rules, where rival families battle for control and power. The political intrigue, mysteries and suspense will suck you in, even if you know nothing about politics. Every aspect of GoT is near pefection, from the story, to the actors, to the characters, to character development, acting, plots, plot-twists, red-herrings, locations, costumes, sets, action sequences, battles, visuals, cgi, soundtracks, buildup, script, dialogue, everything is extremely detailed and polished. Adapted from George.RR.Martin's literary monstrosity, published in 1996, HBO's adaptation has stayed true to the story's roots (even if it has taken some major liberties). It addresses thousands of different themes ranging from the loss of innocence, to war, peace, love, hate, sex, sexuality, philosophy, vengeance, religion, culture, art, music, politics, economics, metaphysics, anthropology, justice, law, morality, spirituality, intolerance, prejudice, civilization, poetry, chaos, global warming, nihilism, pantheism, the destruction of nature, loss of humanity, childhood, adventure, magic, fear, illusions, manipulation, power, death, life, grief, violence, rape, incest, beauty and so.. GoT is filled with magic and the occult but always in a realistic and ominous way, never too widespread or too obvious giving it a sense of realism and mystery that other fantasy stories never have. GoT is also well known for it's shock factor and brutal unpredictability. Always expect the unexpected when watching GoT and try not to get too attached to characters as none are safe (ever). That being said, GoT is without a doubt one of the greatest shows in the history of television. An instant cult masterpiece and a perfect example of unity in form and function.

Season one was very true to the books but season two was not! I understand that since the books are so large the writers cannot fit all the material in the show. This is fine. However, what is not okay is completely changing certain story lines and characters. Season two did this too much! I did not enjoy it as much as season one. Just to name a few - the nights watch story line, Dany's story line, Stannis, theon. I know I'm not the only one who thinks this- I've read several articles online and even non book readers have said season two dragged and was kind of boring. Anyways the reason I gave the show a 10/10 is because they have redeemed themselves with season three! This is one of the best books in the series, so action packed! And the writers have done a great job showing this on television! However, I do highly encourage everyone I know who enjoys the show to dive into the books!

It is a perfect trip guide across history lessons and the near every day reality. It is the perfect door to a fantastic - realistic universe. And, sure, it is GoT. Not The Lord of The Rings, not Lost, not The Tudors or Spartacus. Just and only GooT. The last season reminds this basic truth. Dragons and cruel revenge ( many from us are expressions of frustrations and drawings of wrath), old sandals and swords in new version, sex and battles and traitors, and a drop of relation Luke and Anakin Skywalker. And the end, the so infamous end for many from us, it is real perfect. For a simple reason- it is the fair eulogy of memory of humankind and the right gift to the small details defining us behind appearences. It remains, for me, more than a show, an adventure. Eight seasons. Long months expecting the next season. Impressed by cruelty, in naked expressions, by courage and generosity and loyalty. By few splendid characters. By powerful scenes as the deaths of Hodor or Tommen Baratheon. Shocked by the execution of Nedd Stark, ball of feelings behind Red Wedding.

I put off watching it, didn't feel like it was my type of show. Just watched entire series summer 2018. I was very wrong!!!\nI don't really have a type of TV show. I watch Downton Abbey, Supernatural, Big Bang, all NCIS, chick shows, Originals before they axed it. When Calls the Heart, Jane the Virgin, BBC, Peaky Blinders.\nI go from weepy to shoot em up!\nI did not read the books. I feel like Hollywood butchers TV/movie when they go from book to screen. They feel they have to change the writers words to get big effects! I can't say if this happened with GOT. I've only seen book to screen go smoothly twice. After seeing one movie botched so bad I made a rule. Read book or watch Hollywood version. Not both! I think only the author and fans that read the books should speak on that subject.\nI enjoyed GOT seasons 1-7 so much I would watch it again. The cast was my favorite part. It's got to be hard to put together that many people and have such a brilliant cast. They are the reason for the success of this show.\nSeasons 1-7 you will be on the edge of your seat. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger. This is drama and I love old world fighting. The one line zingers from just about every cast member will keep GOT going on in history for a very long time. The hashtags of all the zingers and lines the characters said will live forever on social media.\nIt's worth watching!!!!\nEven if season 8 was rushed by the writers it's still worth watching, if you have watched 1-7.\nI'm not going into detail why the writers rushed and didn't answer the many question or give more details. All that information is online.\nBottom line 6 episodes wasn't enough!\nHowever, at least there was an ending! I've watched to many TV series that were canceled. The network didn't do a final. I and other fans had to search online: \"is blank show canceled\"\nSo, The millions of fans might not be happy about who is on the Throne!

I don't think that's fair to the cast and crew.\nIt's always a group like writers that bring another group down.\nI feel the writers were selfish and greedy!\nI'm only going by the articles and YouTube videos I've read and seen. The cast & writer of the books wanted a longer detailed season.\nEven with the short 6 episode season I don't feel it was written as well compared to the other seasons.

Well, nothing but I will try to add some nuance into it. First of all, game of thrones season 4 is ma favorite season of every tv show I've ever listened too. The show is globally very good, some of the best acting performance of all time from Sean bean, Charles Dance, Pedro Pascal and, of course, from Peter Dinklage. The story is generally good, surprising and is not boring and predictable like most fantasy stories. Game of thrones and the sources material the books of a song of ice and fire are focus on family, the inside battle of good and bad, etc. Contrary to a lot of fans, I liked the fact that Danny turned mad. She was always power hungry and her ego was totally out of control. I must admit that it should have been done better. What disappointed me was the last two seasons. They are rush and they left too many questions not answer. Why the night king came back now? Who was he? Plus, I really hate the Idea that they chose Bran as a king... He said it himself that he cannot be the lord of anything but being the king of the 6 kingdom he can? And finally I didn't want Jon or any other character to be a fantasy hero like we've seen so many times, but that ending let me feel bad specially for Jon Snow. I do understand that writing a great ending to this awsome show was an impossible task, but this should have been better. Anyways I gave it an 7/10 and after season 8 I can say that Breaking bad was better only because of the great ending of breaking bad and the very bad ending of game of thrones.", "review_date": "23 September 2019", "rating_value": "7"}, {"reviewer_name": "keshavmohadeb", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur91537477/", "data-review-id": "rw5101321", "short_review": "Okay that was heartbreaking", "full_review": "Theres my rating.

When Dany says we won the great war now we will win the last war. I am totally bored with chronological order , i suddenly lost the interest in the show because most anticipated great war already over now what action is there left to be presumed.\n3) Dany's character is built from the start of the show as merciful, kind, humble, just person. And suddenly shockingly the stupid directors of the show wants to trash all the 7 season homework around Dany to make her biggest villian just because they made mistake by finishing their super villian knight king right at the beginning of the season.\n4) Their is no consistency of dragon capabilities.\nWhole show in all previous seasons they depict dragons as the ultimate weapon against cold night king. And when Dragon uses full throw of fire it wont melt a drop out of night king but the dead dragon's blue flame is shown breaking wall magic and making it melt.\nAnother scene jon snow hides behind rock which blue flame of dead dragon cant break or melt.\nBut when last battle start dragon melt down a wall 10 ft thick so easily.\n5) Arya had a chance to avenge her father and kill cersei which was number 1 name on her list but instead she fleds the scene so easily. She trained full season 5 for this task and she didnt do it. Totally Crap.\n6) Sansa Stark who is a coward greedy for throne from the starting of the show gets an independent kingdom so easily when she cant even wield a knife where as Arya who is trained fighter spy gets nothing at all. And three eyed raven cant see who is right or wrong person to be queen.\n7) Dany is killed, dragon, dothraki and unsullied does nothing to avenge her. Rather just arrest jon snow where in previous season they clearly show how these people do instant ruthless justice by killing intantly.\n8) cersei is given a farewell as a lover and just queen, who was shown as an evil ruler and cheater in relationship right from start until last season.", "review_date": "21 May 2019", "rating_value": "1"}, {"reviewer_name": "jmjnjames", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur89536338/", "data-review-id": "rw4876872", "short_review": "Great series.

Excellent actually. But the simple fact of the matter is: the books were better. I know, to a lot of people that seems unfair but I think its impossible watching this show without comparing it to its book counterpart. Everything seems dumbed down. The characters are simplified. For example Tyrion, played by the excellent Peter Dinklage( who despite the criticism I'm giving the character pulls him off marvelously, especially the trial scene in season 4) is dumbed down from a guy who does have a good moral compass but still kills people without any remorse, to a one dimensional hero. The story is dumbed down. Whereas in the Books every action has a heavy consequence, in the show, there either is no conspiracy or Varys and Littlefinger kill someone randomly because the character that killed them in the books(and who has a motivation there) has been cut. But the performances are excellent, for the most part, even though they sometimes misrepresent their original characters (i.e Jaime, Tyrion and Euron). Kudos goes to the child actors who all do a great job despite having no previous experience.

The story itself, with 3 main plots and such nice development across the seasons, could be enough to make your mind. We have the history of the 7 kingdoms in which one of them struggles an allies with the others for power, for love, for family or glory. Everything is connected in the world of Westeros (the main continent where the story goes on). The seize of power, fighting all in all to see who sits on the Iron Throne is the goal here. But another thing and not less important is the characters (and also the cast portraying them) that fills the roles and make us closer and closer as the plot flows. Let me give you a little advice, do not stick too much with any of them, could bring you a lot of grief. Trust me. Landscapes, montage, customs, CGI, everything makes it feel as real as it can be, getting better from season to season. Finally, a mystic, terrible and powerful force is awakening to threat the entire world, and there's an old prophecy that says one day will born a prince that was promise, and his song will be the Song of Ice and Fire, which is the tittle of the whole saga from the books from where the show was adapted.

Seeing as that was unproductive use of my time, I decided to write this review instead so that I could at least get some final thoughts off my chest and hopefully get some sleep afterward. The beginning of episode one was a little slow, as they are with all TV series- they need to introduce characters and set the framework for the entire show, rest assured it picks up quickly. A lot of people seem to have a basis of comparison for this show, having been avid readers of the books by GRRM. For the large majority of readers, they haven't been disappointed with this adaptation. To those of you who haven't read the books, coming from a non-reader herself, the show will have the same brilliant effect. Yes, there are a lot of characters, but after episode 1, you slowly get the hang of it, and each episode leaves you craving for more. The acting is superb and incredibly believable, even the minor characters play their part exceptionally well.

It made you think about it all the time, made you speak like them, and even made you imagine living with them. I honestly can't think of a show that did that for me. I am a music guy and the soundtrack at times made me tear up not only from the soundtrack but from the scenes that the soundtrack was played. I will probably never see anything better in my life. From season 1 to 8 i was hooked, always wanted more so i always watched more. The first character i liked was ned stark he was a perfect character to have in season one. His honor and pride makes you like him and how good of a father he was. I'm not hear here to talk about character i'm here to talk about a masterpiece. People hate on season 8 because of writing, to be honest i don't know much about show or movie writing but i actually liked the story.

There were noticeable character's out of behavior actions and there were plots that were not so well written. Characters' dialogue became duller and inconsistent and questionable plots occurred before Season 8. Even though these setbacks in quality especially in characters' dialogue and story telling and there were unconvincing plots, when the producers announced that the Season 8 will take 2 years to complete, the fans accepted the waiting because we all wanted to enjoy the show so much.\nThen Season 8 came out and it had plot holes and unbelievably bad story telling. I have nothing to complain about its music, acting, cinematic scenes, and CGI (I really don't care about the coffee cup) however the only but the biggest problem with the GoT is that it failed in story telling. The producers destroyed characters personalities and their own individual story. In the end, it made the whole 8 seasons of GoT irrelevant.\nD&D probably thought GoT became so popular because of the fantasy and dragons and CGI's. No! We loved the show because each character lived in the settings of Westeros and some of their actions resulted in ultimate consequence.

I admit, I was apprehensive before I even started it and my perception was that it sucked so it truly didn't stand a chance. Fast forward to spring of 2018, my friend was watching the first episode, right about where I had turned it off, and I expressed my aforementioned opinion of it to him. He implored me to give it another try. So I did, with an open mind, and a better attitude, GOT quickly became not only a GREAT show, but it was inciting extreme interest like no other series I had ever experienced. So began the binging, and it didn't stop until I was out of new content. This show has a unique way of presenting characters that at first, you can't stand, but come to love and cheer for as the story unfolds. In fact, the characters I disliked the most, typically became my favorites and that was a clever and deliberate dynamic that keeps on coming and is only the beginning of so many in this formula. The writing and story arcs are absolutely some of the finest I've ever experienced and again, the character development is in a class of its own. The biggest and possibly only blaring issue I have with GOT is that it's coming to an end, but that's also what makes this show such a treasure to so many people.\nI've never really \"bought in\" to the high fantasy genre over the years. In fact, it was always probably my least favorite of them all. I hope this review can inspire more viewers like me, who have either been closed minded due to the hype surrounding it, or some other reason to give this masterpiece a chance to win them over. GAME OF THRONES is my absolute favorite series EVER and I can't express enough just how unique and original it is.

At first, I felt the only reason for producing this program was to display young Medieval Boobs, so I just had to watch the first episode all the way to the end. After watching the first show, my inclination was that there was no plot, yet digging deeper between the cleavages, I discovered a very intriguing boob\u0085plot. I discovered there were only a few sets of important boobs, the rest were only clever viewer distractions, I will call these - diversionary boobs. Oh, and I will admit, I was taken in by this ploy. Let's face it, there were big boobs, little boobs and even middle-of-the-road boobs\u0085it was like being lost in a vast forest of boobs - how was I to know which were important and which were not? One day my head was spinning trying to figure things out and then it hit me. I noticed that there was a set of royal boobs soaking in milk. This was that eureka moment for me. It was apparent that these two stars were attached to some queen or some sub-queen or something. In any case, I knew these boobs were important. I recognized these as the controlling boobs. One would say they might be nestled in the protective confines of the royal bra. Envy and jealousy forced several sub-boobs into squabbling battles and dangerous alliances - some of which are successful and some are not. All these actions have the endgame goal of wrestling the royal boobs from their protective cups and placing one set of sub-boobs into ultimate control. I kid - truthfully\u0085this is a well directed show and it is very entertaining. The acting is superb with a story that is so intense and spellbinding\u0085the viewer will soon becomes entrenched with all the characters. I will admit, I did not like the show at first\u0085I was such a boob. I am hooked and am now a fan.

The first two episodes were exciting, and engaging, the only real problem that I had with the first two episodes is that the second episode was so dark that you couldn't even see what was even going on, but we got the gist and moved on. I really do not like the fact that Sansa could not keep her word to John, but again it was expected, what was not expected was Daenerys targaryen's slow descent into madness, a slow descent that her father took, and she swore that she would not, but has done anyways. I really don't think that whatever the two brothers names are who created the TV series knew what they were doing with this ending. George RR Martin gave you the keys to his kingdom, and do you have ruined it. Danny is not some ruthless tyrant, in fact you've done a disservice to the character for even portraying her as one, she is not bitter towards innocent bystanders, or even people who have laid down their arms oh, she is a benevolent and kind Queen, not some bitter jerk who decides to burn down the entire city just to prove a point to herself, that she is just as mad, bitter and deranged as her father was, that's the name Mad King aerys. Arya Stark went from completely and totally knightlike, to total pansy in an instant. All because sand or put his hand on her shoulder and said Do You Really Want To Die? Arya Stark would have said not today, Maisie Williams would have been the one who truly ran away in fear. I have never been so disappointed in my entire life is somebody who is open-minded to new and different interpretations of stories. What a waste of a great series. What they don't realize is that all of us would have waited for Martin to put out the Winds of Winter and A Dance in Spring so that the writers could actually have something to write around instead of come up with their own horrible ideas. To be honest I'm sure the George RR Martin is ashamed, and he should be. If anybody should have crafted the last season it should have been him, the guy who freaking came up with the story not to Dum Dums who don't understand how to write a good, cohesive story that brings all perspectives together rather than separates them confuses them and destroys them. I will be watching the last episode, but I kind of don't want to. After seeing what they did in episode 5 I don't think that I would even want to bother watching the last episode, or even the spin-offs for that matter because if this is how they're going to be then I'm not interested. What happened to the character development? What happened to this well-rounded story? We would have waited for something better, in fact we waited 2 years for something better, and instead got something even worse than what we waited for. There is no reason to push something, when you can take your time and make it even better. That is the reason why this last season will fail. George RR Martin takes so long to put out his books because he puts time and heart into every single page, these guys are just hacks who don't understand that concept, the only thing they understand is money.", "review_date": "14 May 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "shaste-95852", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur88183068/", "data-review-id": "rw4814944", "short_review": "Arya the GoT Slayer", "full_review": "Too soon to end the you started 7 years ago.\nwhite walker dies like a mosquito.", "review_date": "29 April 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "harry-95395", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur102012039/", "data-review-id": "rw4808915", "short_review": "Just a incredible show, enough said, just watch it", "full_review": "Just a real good detailed show, with some amazing characters", "review_date": "27 April 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "anitakadar", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur72529119/", "data-review-id": "rw4796618", "short_review": "Great", "full_review": "This is the best TV serie ever known!please don't let it end with season 8.:(", "review_date": "22 April 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "jcg3247", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur22157026/", "data-review-id": "rw4789755", "short_review": "Absolutely.

By the last episode I had made up my mind to read the books. I was amazed to see how close the producers stayed to Martins writing. The actors really felt their parts. Peter Dinklage, Michelle Fairly Emilia Clarke are all stand outs, not to mention all the Stark children. The dialog was almost word for word. From page to screen, Martins prose brought to life, almost exactly like he wrote it. It wasn't really till my second viewing that I really fell in love with Game Of Thrones. Although, I must be honest I missed a lot of the details they left out. Things like Daenerys being dressed before her meeting Kal Drogo, being told that the Kal is so rich even his slaves wear golden collars. Then, her hand maid puts a golden choker around her neck. Daenerys' and Bran's dreams, and the flashbacks to the rebellion that won Robert Baratheon the iron throne just to name a few. I understand sometime its necessary to omit certain things when making an adaptation, but it would have been so easy to include most of this things, but I digress. Now the second season has begun. Having now read the first 4 books I can only hope they can keep true to the VERY complex narrative. So far its only 4 episodes in, and even though they have already advanced the pacing of several story lines and changed many details such as Tywin Lanister being the ruling lord at Harrenhal instead of Roose Bolton, I still find the show a very enjoyable watch. I have read online that HBO has included things from book 3 in season 2.

The series depict intrigues and drama, mostly accurately following the books story line. Of course some minor characters and events are left out since it is impossible to show on the screen all the broad scope of the books. People who say the show is not moving forward obviously didn't read the books (about 1000 pages each). The acting is good on the most part - especially Peter Dinklage who is brilliant as Tyrion, and Sean Bean. Other well-played characters are Catelyn Stark, Littlefinger, Bronn, Pycelle, Varys, Hound, Theon and Daenarys. Joffrey is very annoying as he is smiling all the time, and his facial expressions don't match his cruelty.Some casting problems - the actor who is playing Robb has frozen expression, and a very thick accent. Brienne is not ugly enough. She should be ugly as in the book, because this is one of her motives to be a warrior. Asha Greyjoy is supposed to be sexy and attractive - the actress is not. Margaery should be younger. There is too much sex and gay sex - some scenes were invented and never appeared in the books: the lesbian scene in the brothel, Margaery and Renly on their wedding night, Renly and Loras, Joffrey and the whores.

From what I saw of it, I would warn prospective viewers not to expect another LORD OF THE RINGS. It reminded me more of DUNE. As with so many HBO shows, there's some gratuitous sex and nudity, including truly repulsive scenes where a 10 year old boy suckles at his mother's teat and an effeminate man performs fellatio.

Admirers of the TV/Cable show Game of Thrones are so admiring of the show -- per having read many positive reviews -- precisely because it depicts the fantasy/fantastical story presented in the fantasy book so well. But the book is a fantasy. With so many admirers of the fantasy, a thinking/questioning person begins to wonder why all this \"reach\" and marvel into what even the author of the fantasy contends is fantasy that quite literally has little to do with our current times -- other than the predictable traces of \"human nature?\" I watched the first two episodes of the series and thought okay...it's okay as a story told...but there is really very little to be learned about mankind that we cannot discern from one day's daily newspaper from a large international city -- or a single issue of The Economist; who's in trouble now...and why? I suspect the rigorous and dedicated followers of this show need to be shown a \"world\" that is a distraction, not a distillation, of the more concrete world in which we, the living, live...to be shown a world without the current manifestations of political ambivalence and upheaval, the forces of political expansion and contraction, and most of all, political jeopardy and the individual's political polarization. But this is why I give Game of Thrones a 2-star rating; it is no real help to any of us now...it's simply a distraction. More soberly, why aren't we all wondering why we have been invited to watch the spectacle of slow economic meltdowns of the so-called PIIGS of Europe, all predominantly Catholic nations, without learning of any public, notable financial assistance from the Vatican? Let's define loyalty, really,...and for real.

Unfortunately it no longer has many of those things. The characters have fallen from deep and complex to extremely one demensional and uninteresting. Jon Snow in particular seemed to have lost his entire personality after his resurrection and is now incredibly bland. The deaths in the series now have no emotional weight like they used to. Resurrecting a character destroys the weight of his/her death and the entire sequence just feels as if its begging for attention. Other very bland characters: Bran Stark, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark the edgelord, Ramsay Bolton, even Tyrion and Littlefinger have gone way downhill. It saddens me that the show's quality dropped so far unlike other superior dramas. The series still has a beautiful world and unreal production quality, but the problem lies in the writing which is the foundation for a good series.

I only managed to get through the first season and even that took a lot of energy. I love fantasy as a genre, so it's not like I started out with preconceptions, but the initial exhilaration turned quickly into disappointment once I realized the whole series was based on a very simple structure: 90% of each episode sees two people, sometimes three or more, in a room, a hall, a hut or in a garden, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking.... and then talking some more, mainly about past deeds and dead rulers.

The premise of the season sees Daenarys & Jon Snow combine there forces in an attempt to take on the army of the dead, while Cersei Lannister prepares her forces for an attack from the Dragon Queen. Now Kit Harington has sometimes been accused of being boring as Jon Snow but this season I thought his character was fantastic this season, he is dealing with keeping both Daenarys and his family happy and worrying about the looming threat. Harington uses his facial expressions brilliantly to show just how talented an actor he really is. Emilia Clarke as Daenarys has always been great in the role but her character is given extra depth this season and she does a great job this season. Her character gains more complexity this season and it is great to see a female character given this shine. The Lannisters are back, first Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, now I will admit some of the writing for the character has been a bit mixed but Dinklage's performance has been truly superb this season. He delivers such a good performance this season and you truly believe the trouble his character is going through. Jamie Lannister has been one of my favourite characters over the last few seasons and he is once again fantastic this season showing the development that he has gone through over the show. Cersei Lannister doesn't have as much of a screen presence this season but still is great as a central antagonist. Their is the rest of a huge cast and they all do great jobs this season. The story moves at a quicker pace but I really liked the overarching theme of the season and the character interactions that take place. However, there are a few decisions taken at the end of the season that I didn't agree with and hurt the show a bit. The script is great, the drama is as strong as ever and the sprinkle of humour used really does make these characters more well rounded and feel like real people. The style of the show has never looked better, the cinematography is stunning this season and makes this the most visually stunning show of all time. Overall this season of Game Of Thrones is not the strongest of the show but is another fantastic addition. I have to say I have loved this show from the first episode to the last and I am glad that this show will go down in the history books and ends on a high.", "review_date": "21 May 2019", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "ecryosin", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur98879119/", "data-review-id": "rw4863617", "short_review": "10/10", "full_review": "People wanted it to end like how they theorized it.

Dragons for one have incredible vision, reflexes especially when flying, dragon armor( able to withstand almost any handheld human weapon, I would imagine Valerian steel would be the exception)(would do minor damage from afar but major damage/kill close to very close up from a ballista )and they can breath fire as we have seen in a steep dive. When the ballista bolts were fired at Dani on her attack she could have had the dragon breath fire which would have burnt the bolts to a cinder and slowed them down to nothing. While Dani never lost any speed\nThe odds of a ballista being able to hit a dragon in flight from far away even by surprise is still slim to none. Never mine when a dragon can actually see them coming!!! Also ballista have 3 minor faults which is why they stopped using them in history: the lack of power per distance;\nPoor distance ; reload times it took a crew of 2 just to crank the spring into firing position. So sorry guys but you totally mad that entire sea battle look stupid. Also those ballista bolts would never have done that kind of damage to those ships from that distance ever maybe at 50 to 80 yards but not a quarter a mile away.\nLastly why would Danny run away all she would have had to do was fly around them and hit the black fleet from the rear where they're defenseless???

The books bring an entire world to life, if you haven't' read them, I recommend highly that you do.

Likewise, I hate watching a copy that tries to be a doppelganger of the book (thinking of the Twilight movies here). What I look for is someone to bring the characters to life, and show me more. Whether more something is additional to the story that I read, or only a better depth depends on the movies' production crew, I suppose. For me, thus far, I have enjoyed HBO's interpretation of the faces of the characters and I have seen the storyline followed pretty well, without it being so exact that it just reminded me why reading the story is usually the better option.

(Ok maybe not season 7. While better than season 8 still not up to the standard set in seasons 1-6) I'm not displeased with the decisions made as to who died and who won the game. I actually think those are great parts of the story. I'm just disappointed in how it played out on screen. If you have not seen Game of Thrones, watch it! It's an amazing show! Just know what you are getting into. I would even go as far to say watch the first 6-7 seasons and then just spend twenty minutes reading a synopsis of the last season. That's not being mean, I just don't think it's worth it. The bottom line is this, I enjoyed the show however I do not think I will be drawn into any other show created by the same team. I have no interest in becoming invested in a story and the characters just to better truly let down by the storytellers in the end. If the show were a written book (I know it's from the books.

The characters that were introduced and the ones we said goodbye to had weight! Season 7 was like a gift to the fans! Everything that you wanted to happen happened! But it was almost too much of what we wanted! And it all happened too fast! In past seasons if someone said, I'm going to this place, it would take a few episodes for them to get there and someone probably died along the way! In season 7 someone would say I'm gonna go here and then in the next scene they where there as though no time passed at all! Season 8 sooooooooooo much was forced! Where was the build up? There was none! We here was the development! There was none! It was just pay off! But the pay off fell flat because there was no build up to it! There were two or three deaths that had meaning in this season and only one of them that I wouldn't have changed anything about! All the other deaths just happened!

It only took an hour and thirty something minutes to completely ruin what could have been a beautiful ending and a beautiful storyline. Why would you make Daenerys into what she has tried not to become so hard throughout the series in the end? Why would you let Arya Stark abandon the Hound to a horrible death at the hands of the mountain? For that matter, why would you kill Theon Greyjoy? Why would you kill Jamie, and Cersei Lannister in the way that they did? So many questions that will never be answered due to Lazy writing, poor Direction, and a total disregard for what George RR Martin wrote, and built. There is a reason why every single time George RR Martin puts out a book about Game of Thrones it sells well, he writes a well-thought-out, cohesive, and all-encompassing story that ties together beautifully, sometimes those Thai take a book or two to come together completely, but at least they come together. What the, I can never remember their names, Brothers have done to Game of Thrones is atrocious and downright disgusting and deplorable. They should be ashamed at what they have done. They made Grey Worm into a jerk and killed off Misandry, they made euron Greyjoy into a toned down, downright loser who doesn't even care about anything else but his own legacy, but can't even do anything, other than slay one dragon by surprise and kill Jaime Lannister only to be killed himself. The true Crows Eye would not be killed so easily. Disappointment after disappointment until you are just begging for this show to end at this point. I'd rather see Arya Stark die then live to be the coward that she is, I'd rather see Jon Snow kill Daenerys Targaryen and take her place as the character that she was supposed to be. I don't understand how you can write that somebody would be so bitter about not wanting to have relations with somebody because they are related by blood that they would murder and burn innocent people, and soldiers who have laid down their arms. It blows my mind that this is how Game of Thrones is ending. George RR Martin would be disappointed, and I hope to God that he is disappointed in the ending that these brothers have given us, because it is shameful.

Others might say that the show started to fall off at around season 5. And this is because that's around the time the showrunners ran out of source material to adapt and had to start making up stuff on their own. My personal take: Seasons 1-4 are absolutely amazing, some of the best television I've ever seen and I loved those seasons dearly. Season 5 is where it started to fall a little flat, however, I still enjoyed seasons 5 and 6 for the most part and think they were at least somewhat in the realm of greatness that the previous seasons had been in. However, season 7 and of course, season 8 are where things really started to fall apart. It went from being a show that didn't have \"plot armor\", meaning any character could die at any moment no matter how popular with fans they were, to pretty much every main character getting in situations where they absolutely should not survive but always manage to get saved at the last moment. It went from having great dialogue to them just making lame genital jokes and dwarf jokes. Not to mention that it completely backtracked and ruined pretty much ever character's arc that had been building up to that moment, especially Jaime. I'll never forgive them for what they did to Jaime's character. And a bad ending can really hurt the rest of the show as well, because now I don't even wanna go back and watch the good seasons because I know how it ends and it ends horribly. So, if you've never watched the show, I honestly recommend you don't even bother.

Characters were strong and made great performances and the consequences of their actions turned out twists that enriched the story. Tyrion is by far the best character in this part of the series with his performances and lines and showing how smart characters can influence the story. Season 7 was ok, but it was too rushed and some character choices and logic started to get questionable. Then season 8 made some expectations not matter anymore and made you feel empty and disappointed. For having such a great run for the majority of the show, the finale had to be great or it wasn't worth it. I love the best parts of the show so much, I could just rewatch those parts. But if I want to actually rewatch the show, it's hard to do it because the finale was too disappointing after learning the fate of my favorite characters and how they turn out. There used to be tension where you wondered if your favorite characters would live. It came to where their choices didn't affect their consequences that much and the tension just wasn't there anymore.\nI hope GRRM finishes the books to where we can get the true finale and someone like Netflix or some other network could reboot the series. If you want an example that it can work, compare the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist to it's reboot Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Brotherhood is better because it's the true story that the original author of the manga planned out that didn't have concepts or stories made up like the original series because it was made when the manga was still being published.\nDo it for Game of Thrones.

And second, the serial format is ideal for maintaining fidelity to the spirit of Martin's wonderful story. A major challenge faced by the creators of the Lord of the Rings (LotR) films was the amount of material they had to cull from Toliken's epic tale in order to fit into three relatively short films. The serial format provided by HBO eliminates this problem. In fact, nothing would please me more than to see a PROPER adaptation of LotR filmed in this way. Another pleasing aspect of this series is the obvious devotion to quality.

The Imp is a great character, by far the most interesting of the bunch, so much so that he makes the rest of the characters seem like dull archetypes. The show is also very sexist and gratuitous, and I'm no prude or overt feminist, I'm also a man. The plot line with the princess being more-or-less raped over and over again who then learns how to have sex more efficiently to please the man in question, now it seems she is in love with this man and happy about having his child.... yeah I don't think that's a very convincing or morally sound character arc.

It was something I looked forward to ever week and it hardly disappointed up until the last season. There was thought put behind every scene, every character decision, and every line of dialogue. There were consequences to every action (even years down the road). Everything had a purpose which is why the show was so addicting and so satisfying. However, the last two seasons (some would even say some of season six) started to show some wear and tear. Certain character decisions and motivations didn't line up which at first was ok but then it kept happening. By the end, specifically the last three episodes, nothing seemed to matter and the choices were laughable. Sure it looks great visually but everything else was bad. A show like Game of Thrones needed to nail it's ending because, at it's core, the show was about who gets the throne. When you crash and burn this hard, everything that came before seems worthless.

The plot of the story is breathtaking which captivates the audiences interest within minutes of each episodes. Although the first two seasons were good the seasons that followed were absolutely astonishing. Overall, I recommend this TV show to anyone as it appeals to a large audience.

Sadly, it is often the case that the producers have either chosen a bad book (terrible to watch, but easy to make into a production), or a long book (amazing to read, but cringe- worthy when seen on screen). George R.R. Martin's books are perfect in that they are the right size (per book) for a 10 hour series, and that they also contain the right mix of politics, sex and violence as plot devices. Too much politics will result in a boring drama-fest, too much sex results in a story-lacking, poorly made porn film aimed at enticing male viewers only, and too much violence results in a hideous gore-fest that begins to become repetitive and almost boring, making the viewer tired of seeing the colour red. Game of Thrones successfully incorporates all three of these 'touchy' elements into a watchable and incredibly enjoyable television series, one of the best, possibly THE best TV series I have ever seen. Having read all the books, I can safely say that most, if not all the content in the series matches up neatly to the content in the books. The producers don't overdo anything, keeping to what is written and favouring a complex plot in the place of aimless special effects and video tomfoolery. If you are reading this review, unsure of whether you want to devote 70 hours of your life to this series (because once you start, you won't be able to stop until episode 10 of season 7, at which point you'll be crying because the series has ended), I would have to wholeheartedly advocate the series as one of the best you'll ever see.

I've only seen first two seasons but I'm full with mixed emotions writing this review. From one side there few elements that I like but on the other side so many redundant details/characters bad acting and pseudo cleverness that some times I've straggled to finish an episode appalled from seeing something pretentious, partially baked and not genuine. But at the same time I do enjoy part of the story lines and some of the characters, which are played and developed brilliantly. I'll try to list my biggest cons and pros which may contain some spoilers (only for first and second seasons). So, firstly the whole \"dragons/savages\" story line is completely ridiculous and utterly bad played by practically every character. I've actually hardly overcome and proceed seeing the show after the bad taste the first episode leaved because of all the hideous acting and filming involved in this story line. Second major thing is the general confusion about where the action taking place and the fact that the show couldn't crate (or maybe didn't intend to) a real imaginary/fantasy world. Most of the times you could definitely make a parallel to our reality and place the event somewhere in British Island since the landscape, people (how they talk, dress, look and behave) and rule system is very similar. Some other smaller details contribute to this dissonance for example characters like fencing teacher with an Italian name and accent. This all made me wonder not once whether I'm watching a fantasy or a fiction story about middle ages. I also have an issue with the mass scenes \u2013 there are many of them in the GoT and practically all of them are unrealistic. Scenes like military camps or people gathering are very common in GoT and many times you hear estimation for number of troops, but what you see in reality is very small crowd on the set or simply a camp with many tents but no soldiers. This leads me to conclusion that the wide range of story lines (which I actually like) made the producers to not give every one of them enough attention. Additionally to these but probably less noticeable to most are the sometimes pretentious dialogues about power and higher matters. None of them I actually find hideously banal and indigestible but they are there to contribute to a general mediocrity impression. Despite these major cons and few small ones which I want mention, the show manages to present many brilliant performances and colourful characters. All Lanister's are very well cast and played especially Tyrrion. Jon Snow and Rob Stark are very easy to relate and sympathize. I also consider the brutality and sexual content, although at times redundant, but rather a good tool to characterize human morals and manners at a particular time and place, which is as far as I'm concern is a medieval Britain. As a conclusion I would suggest that the ability to present multiple great heroes and anti-heroes is the essence of the success of GoT. It's not a masterpiece but it neither a trash. It's easy to watch if you neglect some of the story lines and don't care for some recycled dialogues. The tension is building up as the winter is coming and multiple power are about to clash. So, I do eager to follow GoT to the 3 season but I also feel that I may lose interest in it as the cons may prevail over the pros.", "review_date": "16 August 2016", "rating_value": "8"}, {"reviewer_name": "hob_nob92", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur26762166/", "data-review-id": "rw3011603", "short_review": "Good but hugely overrated", "full_review": "", "review_date": "7 May 2014", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "Naseko", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur46318629/", "data-review-id": "rw2862281", "short_review": "Good, but I'm looking for perfection", "full_review": "", "review_date": "2 September 2013", "rating_value": "7"}, {"reviewer_name": "jgkamunye", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur76725239/", "data-review-id": "rw5730583", "short_review": "Bad", "full_review": "Really bad.Worst season ever.Wish I never saw it.Too bad because the first six seasons were pure epic television", "review_date": "12 May 2020", "rating_value": "1"}, {"reviewer_name": "micbar-387-904297", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur34149103/", "data-review-id": "rw2632243", "short_review": "I'm just saying...", "full_review": "PLEASE NOTE THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS OF OTHER SHOWS SUCH AS BREAKING BAD, NOT GAME OF THRONES THOUGH, OTHER SHOWS ARE IN HERE BECAUSE ITS A COMPARISIN. I watched the first episode and I think it's not so good, I mean whats up with all the nudity unneeded and all?it is good I admit, but its not better than breaking bad, especially for being thought out, I didn't read the books and watched it, it starts out foreignly, I shouldn't have to read the books in order to know whats going on. Like Walking Dead, I know whats happening from the start. Here are reasons why Breaking Bad is much better than this... 1. Based on creativity, its not based on a book 2. Reaity, its the only show where it shows the characters choose their fate. 3. Backstory, it has flashbacks that are enough of a back story, not an entire episode's time like LOST. 4. Danger, they switch enemies ever so often, each time getting more and more powerful and dangerous, yet while Walt struggles to keep his spot in the king lineup and focuses to get there himself, with every takeout/move he makes getting more dangerous and powerful himself. the only movies good with one enemy through the series are Harry Potter, The Walking Dead (which has more than one zombie), The Mummy (remake, first two), and Batman (The joker's returning) 5. It really happens, things like this, can happen, unlike medieval time that... 6. It has a point, You feel things, pain, regrets (and there not coming from buying the seasons) but you feel what the character feels, it makes you feel like your right there with them in the fight. Like 3D but its not... 7. Acting, Bryan Cranston was amazing even in Malcom, no one could be that good, Aaron Paul is a perfect junkie, Matt Jones plays Badger perfectly. Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte, there all perfect, enough said there... 8. They end the show before it gets out of hand, its gonna end in sixteen episodes, sixteen heart-racing downfall episodes that lead to mist, with one question... What happened to Walt? What is going to happen to him? I bet if this show would have eighteen books thud make twenty-two seasons, put two books in one season, simple as that, before they get out of hand, more realistic.

The thing that makes Game of Thrones so much better than any show I have ever watched is the story lines, in every episode there is about 3 main story lines going on while 1 or 2 side stories are also going on. So you have a variety of stories to look forward to. The next great thing about this epic show is the characters, there are so many characters on Game Of Thrones that when i first watched I couldn't keep up with all the names. A Hero can't be a hero without a villain and this show has some pretty messed up villains. Like the boy King Joffrey for example who terrorized Westeros for 3 seasons, or the even crazier Boltons who just love to skin people alive. For me this show has so many episode highlights but here are a few I'd say are what makes Game Of Thrones the epic that it is. Baelor, The Rains of Castamere, The watchers on the wall, Hardhome, Battle of the Bastards, and The Winds of Winter. Those are just episodes I consider a perfect 10 out of 10. Although there are many other episodes that I'd say are pretty perfect as well.

Brilliant characters, dark & gritty plot with twists, great dialogue, great settings, great soundtracks. It's a truly one of a kind unique show. After watching the first 6 seasons, Season 7 is optional. It's not bad but not great either. It has its' special moments too though. But when it comes to Season 8, forget it. You're better off imaging your own final season in your head because it'll be better than what this show prduced. Logic doesn't exist anymore this season. Characters are dumbed down and have lost their depth. It's very rushed and short. It's a disgrace of a season to a show this great. Once again, you can come up with a better ending to Game of Thrones in 10 seconds than what Season 8 really is. It's skippable.

And sometimes even after finishing a movie or a series it takes time to make up your mind about it. don't get me wrong am not trying to give lessons here on how to rate a show, after all; this is a matter of opinions and affections based on various backgrounds many of them are subjective ! Keep in mind that most of high ranked series when it comes to the final season it gets turned away by the wide audience. In most cases this judgement is purely sentimental ! beside getting over-hyped, closures are hardly accepted by the majority. But what bothers the most is the black and white duality in human thinking and that's beyond just a tv show criticism..\nNow before me here getting into details concerning my opinion which gonna be objective for two reasons, one is i never read the books and i don't open my ears to theories. this is a choice i've made for every book-based series so not to get oriented to other directions and to keep the track of the story lines and the dramatic plot of the show itself. As it is known there is a big difference between a book and a series and they can't be related otherwise you gonna get false thoughts and assumptions, and eventually disappointed.\nThe second reason proving my objectivity is that i followed up the show periodically since it first aired in 2011. which means that i'm not riding on the wave of its success ! with that being said you should know that i have nothing against those who follow the trend that's 100% legit but be careful not to make prejudgments and get driven by others reviews.\nAfter trying to understand the common arguments of those who found themselves failed by this season i believe that i came across two categories those who were expecting more from one character or another and didn't appreciate the role they played or the ending they faced, and those who had an issue with the plot and the story orientation itself.\nFor the first category it reflects a conviction that the show succeeded in implementing the sympathy and compassion around the main characters good and bad ones ! put in mind that at one point when your affection for a character that didn't get what it deserves from your perspective makes you angry about the whole show then you must give it the credit because it lead you to pick a side and that's the point !\nOne more important thing concerning this subject, a truly realistic series or a movie is not about demonstrating heroes or satisfying the need for justice and happy endings. and that's why after watching more than 40 series for a decade know, i can fairly say that GOT is one of the most realistic tv shows i ever saw even with dragons and dead walkers in it ! you see; this series is a character driven type of writing and despite what you may think the focus is not on the story but on the characters and their attitudes, personal evolutions and decisions, and how those, in turn, change the shape of the plot and the story as a whole.\nThere is three main decisions made in this season finales, killing the night king, burning king's landing to the ground, killing danny ! now those decisions are made by three different main characters; arya, danny and john those are by far the most developed and evolved ones throw out the series, the path they took and the endings they had are convenient just on the base of the story telling with all objectivity you can't say nothing about their progress! therefore the questions of who and why are settled in my opinion but how the decisions are made that's up for discussion we don't say perfection is in this show far away from that, and on the other hand we should not forget when it comes to cinematography this show nailed it for real !. Same for the rest of the cast they all had their significant endings in accordance with their story lines no one was left behind am not saying deserved the endings they get that's the subjectivity am trying to avoid but a solid structural framework made most of the endings reasonable. And this take me to other category of critics which is based on the plot and how the twists aren't effective or less than expected which is already ironic as a statement ! from where i stand i get disappointed when i make the right assumption. doesn't mean that i should be impressed if you come up with something out of no where. A good plot twist is when you make a reason for it without paying attention from the spectators and that's what GOT succeeded in illustrating !\nIn total am satisfied it was a good wrap, it ended the only way it could have, given the circumstances. One more think! the message was strong by the melting of the throne! the moral is obvious and the game was ended, the position bran took doesn't really matter if you truly understand the point that the show want to transmit, so no need to make of it a big deal because it's no longer about who sits on the throne...\nGOT is definitely on my top five list !

Almost every line, every moment and every scene is filled with complicated and intriguing emotions and situations. With every episode the characters grow bigger and bigger, creating a realism and depth you rarely see in today's television series. The only thing that i found irritating from time to time was the fact that the environment (and perspective) changes a lot, giving you the feeling of hopping through the world, every time a scene gets really interesting, the camera hops away to another perspective.

You never get borred because thare a lot of plots and a lot of char. and every year you got a new char. The fights and the sneaky plots i love the most but every one can see that it's much more than only that. I hope they can keep me surprise every time with something that happens wat you don't expect. I hope they can keep it up. I read the books and it's really interesting to see wat the differends are with the books and the TV series. There are a few things differend but it doesn't bother my (normely it does). If you are twisting and turning to watch this show i you don't know yet i just say watch a few episodes and you will be hooked on this one.

They're not wrong. Because they also did for the characters themselves, as the entire episode is about who we all are, or what we reveal ourselves to be the moment fear takes control of us. It's sudden and dramatic by fear's very nature. The episode's title, \"The Bells\", even calls to attention the precise instant this happens for most of our key characters.\nWe see it in the war scene itself. It's not so much \"one good side versus one bad side\" as much as it is just one collective mass of people scared fighting for their lives, and all it takes is one catalyst to bring that collective fear all the way to the forefront and, amidst pure chaos, for everyone to find out who they truly are.\nDany is that catalyst. As we know, she is already afraid. But once she hears the bells of surrender in King's Landing, that's the moment the fear fully takes hold of her. The throne, the one thing she's always wanted is now finally hers for the taking. The people of King's Landing do not love her, and she will not lose the product of her life's work the way she did everything else, so she does the only other thing she sees she can do: \"Let it be fear\". She torches the city.\nSo, motivated by fear, this is the very moment she puts the fear in everyone else. The walls break down completely. All masks come off. Everyone's true selves and desires rush to the forefront.\nGrey Worm, feeling only wrath from the love taken from him, seizes this opportunity to massacre innocent surrendering forces.\nFormerly surrendering forces fight for their lives. They want only to survive.\nSome of the victorious forces of the North do the same, while others seize the opportunity to wreak savagery upon innocents. It's who they were all along, and we've taken their good will for granted.\nWe've all seen Jon Snow's face of realization: \"This is wrong. This was wrong all along.\" From that point on, he can only make futile attempts to correct what can't be undone.\nKnowing it's all over, Cersei's thoughts turn entirely to her unborn child. It's not about \"who wins\" the throne anymore. To her, the throne was merely her and her family's refuge, a refuge she held by committing countless evils in the name of protecting herself and those she loved. Now, all she knows is that she cannot let her unborn baby die, not here. She flees. She weeps for her child.\nAnd even among all of this, the sound of the bells was only the moment the fear hit most of our characters. Others had fear take control of them slightly prior, but the bells served as the crossroads for those very fears nonetheless.\nThe moment fear took control of Jaime was one episode prior. By every observable metric, he was a changed man that had every intention of atoning for his past. But the moment Sansa told him that Cersei would be executed without him, that's when his fear took hold. He could not let the woman he'd loved his entire life, from the moment of their birth, die without him there. It was not a \"reversal\" or \"squandering\" of his character arc. He had indeed become a better man. But he was the only person to ever see that side of Cersei, and he was afraid to let it die. Even at the moment of he and Cersei's death, he tells her \"it's just us, that's all that matters\". The fear made him realize that his memory of that love is all he would have been content with, and given familial love being the sole motivator for all of Cersei's sociopathy, it was literally his answer to her lifelong struggle.\nObviously, The Hound fears his brother. He knows this crossroads at King's Landing is his chance. He fears NOT getting revenge, and Arya thinks she shares this in common with him. So as a litmus test, he makes it as clear as he can to Arya: if you follow me down this path, you will die.\nAnd despite all her talk, that is the moment the fear hits Arya. She doesn't want to die. She runs through the streets trying to escape, and in doing so finds that she doesn't want the people to die as well. Fear triggers her survival impulses, not just for herself, but for others as well. She's afraid to die. There's more she needs to do. There's more everyone needs to do.\nAnd lastly, or firstly rather, seeing the crisis of \"the bells\" coming days in advance in true character fashion, Varys remains the person he's always been. He fears the wrong person being seated on the throne, one that leads by instilling this very fear in them at all, the fear that arises from fire and blood.\nAnd that, my friends, is why this episode is brilliant. It is pure Game of Thrones. We're nothing but sacks of meat and blood, and some bone to keep it all standing. When life-or-death fear hits, we become our basest, most elemental selves, and no one is invulnerable.\nCharacters' arcs shift fast because the whole episode is about fear and who we reveal ourselves to be once that fear is put in us.", "review_date": "17 May 2019", "rating_value": "9"}]}, {"ImdbId": "tt0944947", "reviews": [{"reviewer_name": "ama-96287", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur78847939/", "data-review-id": "rw4855900", "short_review": "This season is week", "full_review": "The Best cgi and cinematography but writing in this season is bad", "review_date": "15 May 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "bryan-879", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur32813093/", "data-review-id": "rw4851678", "short_review": "WHAT A SHOW!", "full_review": "This show is epic in every way.

By the way, I think Iwan Rheon is a great actor but thought he could have done more. And I think Peter Dinklage, Aiden Gillen, Kit Harrington, Maisie Williams, etc. are all great actors.

I was never really a fan of Lord of the Rings and  fantasy so I didn't think this show was gonna be as good as everyone  said it was. I couldn't have been more wrong. It is epic!   You start off with you know pretty good stuff there's a twist at the  start which gets you into it and then it builds up and then at the end  of the first season you're like wtf just happened?! How can they do  that lol this is GOOD. Yeah so you're like damn this is a good show  still not as good as like Sopranos or Breaking Bad or whatever. Then  you get through season 2 and you're still thinking this is a damn good  show then once again at the end you're like this is sick! Then you get  to 3&4 and you know that this is the best show out there. I can't  explain and I don't wanna tick the spoiler box so I'm gonna just say  some serious 'stuff' goes down. Twists like once an episode, battles  which are epic, some emotional stuff as well. Game of Thrones does  annoy you with the stuff they do sometimes but there is this one bit  which is a massive 'hell yeah' moment which seems like a treat for the  fans. Then season 5 is a little bit under the usual standard I must  say, still amazing though, but the last few episodes of it are still  sick, probably some of the best there. Season 6 is my personal  favourite though. It is amazing! So much stuff that you can't even  imagine it's just too good. I'm not even gonna say anything it's just  INCREDIBLE.   This show is the most well acted, directed, written, produced show out  there. The budget is phenomenal and you can tell in the episodes. The  work they must put into every aspect of the show is incredible. The  massively well planned twists, the incredible battle scenes, the  humour, the connection with the characters; it all is just so so good.  I cannot wait for season 7 and I bet its gonna somehow be better than  the show is already. Best show out there I'm telling you. If you haven't  seen it yet, watch it.

It is a stunning mix of fantasy, drama, and medieval warfare. The book series turned TV show is truly audience engaging with its great cast, attention to fine details, and suspenseful storyline. The cast of a show either makes or breaks it, in Game of Thrones the cast definitely makes the show. Before the end of the first episode, the audience can't help getting attached to certain characters and hating others. One character that the audience can't help but hate is Prince Joffrey, who attacks a helpless boy who is pretend sword fighting. After Joffrey gets hurt he has his father, the King, order to have the boy killed. A character that viewers can't help but love is Arya, the daughter of the King's best friend. Arya doesn't follow the social norms set for girls, she wants to learn how to fight, be rough, and ride horses like her brothers. When caught pretend sword fighting with her friend she fights back against the Prince not caring about his status. Jack Gleeson and Maisie Williams bring these characters to life. Without the amazing actors and cast there wouldn't be a huge following of the show, which includes over seven million people who watch the show just on TV not including those who watch online. The details are an important part of any book, movie or show. This show is no different because there are so many small details that could easily be forgotten. One would think that the style of clothing, type of armor, or even silverware used to eat wouldn't make a different in watching the show, but it truly does. The clothing distinguishes the poor from the rich, and those who live in warm climates in the south from those in the north in the cold. The armor displays that someone is a knight, or a war soldier. The silverware exhibits financial status. Each noble family in the kingdom has their own personal symbol, and when they travel or go to war, flags with the symbol are carried with them. These details didn't come without extreme cost .When watching it is easy to understand why it costs over five million dollars to film each episode. It probably would have been easier to film in front of a green screen, but that would have taken away from the authenticity of the story. The show is filmed in authentic locations all around Europe from Iceland, Spain, Croatia, Ireland, to Malta. When reading a book or watching a movie, it is usually easy to predict the ending. It often times ends when the boy gets the girl and they live happily ever after. This does not happen in Game of Thrones. All sixty minutes of each episode is action packed. It is nearly impossible to predict a certain character's fate because of the action packed scenes and suspense, even if they seem like a main character. When watching the audience can't help but sit on the edge of their seat not knowing what's going to happen. When past events are tied to recent event, it creates a \"ah ha\" moment that helps viewers understand a certain character's actions in the past. What makes Game of Thrones great is that it is truly unique, with the use of mystical animals. However, a comparable show is Vikings, in both shows the goal is to become King by overcoming numerous obstacles. If you're looking for a show that is action packed, and full of suspense then Game of Thrones is the show for you. Full of great actors with whom the audience can't help but form an emotional attachment to. The attention to fine details creates a sense of authenticity of how the people in the kingdom live. A major point to consider when watching is that no one is ever safe. It never turns out the way the audience anticipates, the future can never be predicted. It will leaving you with a cliffhanger ending.", "review_date": "18 June 2015", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "raheembutt07", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur45843394/", "data-review-id": "rw3080549", "short_review": "Not enough male nudity and gay sex", "full_review": "", "review_date": "4 September 2014", "rating_value": "5"}, {"reviewer_name": "SAWTIMBERINC", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur3751760/", "data-review-id": "rw2779313", "short_review": "Great Show, BUT", "full_review": "Guess I am really getting old, I get lost in the characters.

For the people like me who haven't read the novel there is so much of story to soak up that it's easily to get lost and to be left with a need to rewatch the episode to fully grasp the big picture. But as the series continue and plotting of characters (that you are already familiar with from the first episode) progress you will start to clue the puzzling threads together.

I only kept watching because,asides from rave reviews, and a fabulous cast, I did enjoy the stunning scenery, and actually recognized some of the non-CGI'd landscapes from my childhood, as some scenes were shot where I grew up. All the scenery, however, is amazing- and I find myself totally drawn into this fictional land as a result. I will say though that it took me the most of season 1, to get a feel for the show, and while it was really slow for me at coming together, the first season ended with everything that I was hoping for. I never read the books that led to this screenplay, but if the screen adaptation is anything to go by, I would imagine that it would be like one of these books that you have difficulty getting into, but once you do you absolutely can't put it down.

The intertwining story arcs tell a compelling story, in which there are no definitive goodies or baddies, although British viewers might pick up on the annoying pattern whereby the more northern somebody's accent is, then the more likely they are to be noble (and will also be a bit confused at how people in the same family can have randomly acquired Manc, Scouse or Geordie accents\u0085). Also, despite the fantastic sets, you do sometimes feel a bit short-changed with the visuals. Viewers groomed on the visual splendour of the likes of the lord of the Rings may feel a bit let down by the made-for-TV feel of supposedly epic scenes. Rather than fearsome armies, most of the troops and 'battle' scenes sometimes don't fool us into believing we are watching anything other than what they really are, namely a small group of extras on horses and holding cardboard shields in a field in Northern Ireland. And the sex? I love a bit of porn as much as the next man, but in GoT it does sometimes seem a little gratuitous. In one scene, where Bran is talking to the wild woman, a naked 'giant' appears from the bushes, before he is told to go and put some clothes on and runs off. What on earth did that have to do with the story other than the chance for us to see another penis? And it does get very confusing at points. The first episode introduces so many different characters that when it gets to the key scene at the end, I was so lost that I had no idea who the two people were in the tower, let alone that it was a queen having sex with her brother. The series does a great job of explaining everything, but even so, for those like myself who never read the book, it's hard to follow who the various hangers on in the court in the south and the seemingly eternal string of Stark siblings are. Names like Jaime, Theon and Tyron keep cropping up, but it all happens so fast that the less informed viewer ends up not having a clue who they are talking about. But these gripes aside, what a terrific series and I can't wait for the second. Unlike so many series, in this one it really is hard to see what's coming, helped by the fact that a number of central characters get killed. In GoT, you never feel the dramatic tension lost because you know there's no way so-and-so is going to be killed. I was dreading a similar fate would befall Daenerys \u0085 one of the most delightful pieces of eye candy ever to appear on TV. And the underlying message for me at least is how so many real battles were fought not for the good of the people but to satisfy the whims of royalty. It is the growing threat from north of the wall that these people should really be worrying about, but instead they continue to shed blood in the name of their petty family feuds. A nice allegory for how the world today sees nations vying with each other rather than fighting for the things that really matter.", "review_date": "4 December 2011", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "martin_the_man", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur65224424/", "data-review-id": "rw4824856", "short_review": "Dont listen to the people giving 1 star", "full_review": "Although Episode 3 of season 8 have some faults it still is one of the best things ever seen on screen, these rating of 1 star just tell how biased alot of people are after fantasizing about millions of different theories.

Everyone, especially the child actors, are extremely well cast and all give convincing performances. The story is compelling and does make you want to see more however, for me, there are a few things that let this series down. Do not get me wrong, I love many American series and films, however, no one, not even the Americans themselves, can say they are known for being subtle (or particularly realistic). The sex in this series is gratuitousness and feels like its just been thrown in because they think the audience will get bored if there isn't something going on every second. This really detracts from the realism of not only the events but also the relationships between the characters. I know that a certain amount of sex and violence comes with the genre and I didn't think the violence was too bad however, I find it hard to sympathize with characters where the majority of their personality centres around sexuality (e.g.constantly using prostitutes or raping women every five seconds). To be fair, however, the non-sexual relationships, such as between ayra and her father feel genuine and real.

They are both great characters and you see the both of them develop this season and the show does a really good job showing them in unique lights that makes them more interesting. All the supporting cast is great, tryion, cersei and Jaime lannister all have great moments this season that further enhance them as some of the best characters on any TV show. Sansa and arya stark are given bigger roles this season and it works really well as there story develops in a very unique way that I wasn't expecting. I could go through every supporting character but I would be here all day so just know that the performances are top quality. The story this season is shorter then previous seasons but I really feel they did a good job of balancing the different story lines. I really enjoyed the development of the white walker storyline and I feel like that is really the end game for the show. I also feel the relationship story lines were handled a lot better this season. The script is great, the drama really works this season as more characters get reunited the tension does rise. But also for certain characters the humour was also really handled well. The style of the show has never been grander as the effects are incredible, the battle scenes are massive this season with the scale really delivering.

First off the writing. The show does a brilliant job translating the books to the small screen, and besides some notable changes, like the character difference of Renly Baratheon and the missing character of Lady Stoneheart, the shows remains faithful to the books in the first four or so seasons. While most of the show is built with dioulouge, I was still interested in the conversations, as they often revealed main plot points, characterization, or were just plain interesting. Season 5 does have a little too much dialogue, and it can get boring at times. Yeah, GOT has a obscene amount of deaths, but most of them make sense and aren't there for pure shock value, though there are a view that are used for shock value, like OSHA's death. In Red Wedding, it makes sense for everyone to be murdered because Walter Frey has a legitimate reason to kill everyone. Also, when John Snow dies, that makes sense because who wouldn't be mad at Jon for siding with the enemies? The characters are all written in depth, and you feel attachment towards them. Because of the more realistic tone, we can associate with the character's thoughts and feelings, as they closely associate to our thoughts and feelings. What I'm saying is that most of the character's are written very well and make the show as good as it is. The political drama is awesome and is shockingly relevant to the plots and schemes that are going in politics today. In my opinion, Got shows how ruthless politicians can be in their quest for power, and also shows relevance in other issues such as prejudice, tolitarism, and invasion of privacy that are found in world politics today. The acting is spot on, and notable performances include Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Lena Heady, and Kit Harrington.\nAlso, the set pieces really make the show, and despite some slip ups in the final season, they all fell totally real and you felt immersed into the fantasy world. The directing is absolutely astonishing for every episode, and all the battles and fights feel epic and intense. The cinematography is also amazing, and really captures the mood of the scenes. Overall, GOT is very well written, features great characters, shocking doses of realism and real life politics, heartbreaking deaths, great acting, and great directing. One last thing. I know the finale was disappointing and pretty bad. However, the rest of the series was knockout tv, and I can kind of forgive the finale just because GOT still gave us those magnificent final seasons. 10/10", "review_date": "9 June 2019", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "pfelipebr", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur24934367/", "data-review-id": "rw4890553", "short_review": "It's a great show - the greatest", "full_review": "Incredible how they capture a medieval fantasy world with all the complexity of real human interactions.

A lesson that will be learn by all, even the former US president Barack Obama comment on that. And as for the me, the most touching theme is the bridge between the rich and the power, the series tends to portray a narrative that tells how this equation is truly unbalance, the WILL that has been written between the rich and the poor. Since the beginning of time this has been a major problem in societies and it remedy is truly tedious to find, so the movie tells us how this thing will be constantly going back and forth.

The world today seems to have really low standards when it comes to entertainment. They want sex, violence, and special effects. While the show has an abundance of all 3 that doesn't mean it's a great, or even good source of entertainment.\nI'm noticing a pattern with this show and a few others that have come out recently. Mainly that, and I want people who have seen it to really think about this: Nothing happens. Nothing happens, insert a sex scene or 10, then somebody dies in some horrific way and it's supposed to be shocking and keep you engaged. Honestly, when I really think about it, it's quite boring.\nHere's the other major problem I have. The characters. Characters in film today are not like they used to be. They're not sympathetic or heroic. They try to make the characters seem that way, but it's known that people today are easy to please, so a character makes a simple little gesture and suddenly that puts them on a pedestal. The lead character, \"our hero\", Jon Snow, for instance, is so unbelievably boring. He's not a well developed character and he's pretty much just reciting his lines and standing around. The other characters, to put it bluntly, are: MEH. With 1 or 2 exceptions, but if or when these characters die, I honestly dont care, which is unfortunate, because I crave characters to love.\nThe costumes are ok. The ladies dresses look like curtains, but the armor is interesting. The sets are typical medieval stone castle sets, and the scenery is lovely in some spots.

That's just what this show is, an adaptation. It's fine to make some smaller changes here and there and I love most of the original TV scenes that weren't in the books, like Littlefinger and Varys' conversations, Robert and Cersei, Cersei and Joffrey, that White Walker scene with Craster's baby in The land of always Winter, I mean, that's just amazing! I'm okay if the show does some different things as long as it doesn't just completely do it's own thing, which they started doing eventually. The show starts off fantastically and it's almost just like if you were reading the books, only that it was made somewhat differently for TV. The characters are basically all there and the casting was excellent, the plot and the story was totally nailed and we all knew that the show was in good hands, it was almost perfect. Season one was pretty much the way they should have kept the show going but it seems that the show got worse when they tried to change things. They changed many things, cut and completely altered several characters (changed their names even, like wut?) Some bad changes happened in season 2 already, like the Daenerys' Quarth plot, her dragons, Xaro Xhoan Daxos and the house of the undying as well. They should have stuck with the characters' story lines, (just naming a few names here:) like Gendry, Edric Storm, Thoros of Myr, Melisandre, The Hound, Brienne/Podrick (and many of the traveling companions/foes they meet on their quest), Bronn (especially), the Tully family (Cat, Edmure and Brynden) and their relationship, Hoster Tully, who was mostly cut from the show, and so much more that I could just write an essay about it. One of the things the show seems to do is, instead of just introducing new characters like in the books, they just merge their plotlines together and sometimes they're part of things they weren't part of in the books. Even though the show does this, it does, however, get a lot of things right and it works pretty well as a whole, I just wish they'd stop changing things... Like the title says, the first four seasons were amazing, to great. I praise the first season the most because it's most faithful to the books, the other three seasons were great as well however, but then we get to season five, and onwards, and everything just goes crazy. The first two books fitted in one season each, S1 and S2. Book three was actually split up in two seasons, S3 and S4! Which was just great, but I wonder if they could have actually made three. Then we get to book four, and five. Yep, they made book four and five into one single season, when they should have done three. Season five should have been for book four, and seasons six and seven should have been for book five (parts 1 and 2). I can't (curse word) believe that they made season five that way, book five is almost just as long as book three, which got two seasons! In my opinion, the should have just stuck with making a book adaptation instead of going completely off the rails (or should I say, off the books?) with seasons 6 and onward. They should have stopped at season 7, probably, when they were done with the book adaptations, and waited with patience for Georgie boy to finish book six, just like we book fans have been doing since 2011. Meanwhile, they could have made spinoff series like they're planning on doing right now so it wouldn't be completely dead to people. That would have worked! People would just have to be a little more Patient, like us! They could have made book six into two or three seasons, since it's gonna be so incredibly long (1500 pages!!) and then wait for book seven, which I am very doubtful will be released in the near future, if ever. Overall it's a great show, and I know this isn't IMDBooks but seriously, you should read the books first. I'm giving it a strong 9 / 10, close to 10 / 10, the first four seasons alone are just that good but then season five, six and seven came along and it GoT worse. I would probably rate the books a 10+ / 10, just saying!...

The show follows the book in a great way although there are some changes but its alright as books and shows cannot be completely same.

It - to me was a bit like Sons of Anarchy in that it took a while to get in to and work out what is really happening. There are times when verbose confusing conversation dullens the sensual-ness of the awe inspiring scenery and sexy beyond words boys and girls. To clarify a point I have read in past reviews that this is set in a medieval time. No nothing can be further from the truth. Medieval times were a set period in human history from the 5th to the 15th century. I don't recall ever when they specify the time or date in GoT, this is not human history it is fantasy that is 'Reminiscent' of that time. The suggestion that there is too much Gratuitous sex is also to my mind incorrect. There is indeed a lot of Nudity and some sex but it isn't soft porn by any stretch of the imagination. The reason GoT sucks you in is that we develop personal likes and dislikes toward certain characters much like football teams and when a much loved character is murdered it seems almost unbelievable so of course your emotional side requires you to seek reprisal for the fallen by watching further until next thing you know the whole series is over. If it wasn't for the dull conversations about what King owns what land and did what to whom I would easily have given this 9.9 out of 10 but unfortunately that is not so.", "review_date": "26 October 2014", "rating_value": "7"}]}, {"ImdbId": "tt0944947", "reviews": [{"reviewer_name": "edwardwll", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur45515686/", "data-review-id": "rw2845853", "short_review": "Not even close to braveheart - i don't like GOT that much", "full_review": "", "review_date": "31 July 2013", "rating_value": ""}, {"reviewer_name": "snh108", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur36109293/", "data-review-id": "rw2698562", "short_review": "2nd season was disappointing", "full_review": "", "review_date": "2 November 2012", "rating_value": "7"}, {"reviewer_name": "danicl07", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur20308210/", "data-review-id": "rw2504147", "short_review": "Why these additional SCENES?", "full_review": "Well I must say I was pleasantly surprised the first few episodes of this series as to how well it represented the book. I thought the casting was outstanding, the acting impressive and the scenes beautifully executed. One of those few novel-to-screen adaptations that represented exactly what the author portrayed. However, the most recent episode I've watched(epi 5 the wolf and the lion) disappointed and shocked me! Firstly-the homosexual relationship between Renly and Loras was not only an addition not mentioned in the book but didn't seem to add anything to the plot. If anything, I am concerned it will complicate the storyline and betrays their characters! Renly is self conscious and whiney-not reflective of his robust and outgoing personality in the book, and in the book Loras was a hit with the ladies so I don't see what the purpose of adding that was. Don't misinterpret this as homophobia of any sort, I simply feel it was untrue to the book. And the second scene that bothered me was between Cersei and Robert. There was never such an intimate and friendly encounter between them represented ANYWHERe in the book as the scene where she practically counseled him on his decision to attack Dany. This scene in the show portrayed them, while not as in love, as friendly and almost a mutual respect that completely contradicts with their relationship. The Robert in the book would never have listened to her and she couldn't have stood to have spoken to him without the acrid and sarcastic demeanor she always appears to exhibit towards him. Up to the point I've been so impressed but frankly this episode outrages me! Mr Martin signed off on this???

OK, I agree with this but the book foreshore did not point out Ned as the movie does.

As a viewer you feel at times that you have been a surrogate member of the Stark family as you move from one season to the next. 4 or 5 different but linked stories in one - each as enthralling as the next, though Jon Snows adventures at the Wall are the heart of it all. Kit Harrington is excellent in that role. Peter Dinklage brings Tyrion to life in spectacular fashion and Emilia Clarke is stunning as Daenerys. It feels as if their characters were written for them. How good too are Maisie Williams as Arya; John Bradley as Sam; Lena Headey as Cersei and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime? You could literally go through the whole central cast without finding fault. Dianna Rigg and Charles Dance perhaps two more to highlight. This could all have easily been a let down from Martin's original books but the tv production even surpassed those until its penultimate episode. Sadly we needed at least 2 or 3 more episodes in that final season before that episode for it to make any sense.

Well- developed characters face harrowing challenges and embark on quests full of death and glory, which categorize Game of Thrones as an adventure-drama. When I watch an adventure-drama, I expect to see exciting scenes of action unfold and plot lines that develop and take unexpected turns. I want to be engaged in the action as much as the dialogue and expect to see character development throughout. Game of Thrones is sure to keep you entertained for it includes: stylized action, drama, and fantasy. \"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention\" (Ramsey Snow, Game of Thrones). I rate Game of Thrones 10 out of 10 stars. My expectations are met each time I watch the show as the plot progresses and action unfolds. Main characters face challenging ordeals and often meet their deaths in the vicious, yet realistic, fictional world of Westeros. Strong violence and upsetting content drives the dark tone of the show, which helps make it an even better drama.", "review_date": "26 October 2017", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "eennzzoo", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur68043840/", "data-review-id": "rw3842143", "short_review": "Excelente series", "full_review": "Game of Thrones's comeback was awesome, amazing plots, awesome characters and again awesome dialogue and writing, Dan Weiss and Benioff do some nice works on converging the story-lines and i am okay with it, no way they would squish 1000 pages of a book in 10 hours, they do a fine work with what they can, and GoT is their gold mine.

Characters without Manichaeism in a world without heroes incontestable. A complex and fascinating universe filled by intricate political intrigue. A real lesson of geopolitics, military science and political science. Apart from all the credits due to the mind of George R. R.

Some characters are though much more boring than than the Norse characters, for example Cersei and Jamie. Sigmund and Sigi, the incestuous twins that have a child(Sinfjotli) that murders the king and his children. After this leaves his mother queen and sinfjotli eventually is poisoned. This is one of many examples on exactly who the characters in the series are based, not to mention that the entire story is Ragnarok. White walkers, dragons and a very well placed Loki in the form of petre baelish . If Baelish didn't exist stark never goes to kings landing,john Aryan lives, cersei and kids die along with daenarys and etc. One of the funnest aspects of the whole series is the way it hints as to what will happen next. For example the irony of tyrion telling oberyn you could at least wear a helmet or theon saying he will look like a eunuch. Although i enjoy the series the books are well worth the read as the series does edit much of what it considers filler out. I enjoy the banter of the characters in the books more than i do in the series and of course my favorite parts are almost never put in the show. While the last season strayed further away from the books I'm happy to see it go in that direction and leave more surprises for us fans.

When King Robert comes all the way to the North- the ancient kingdom of the Starks to seek help from his best mate Ned Stark, the honorable Lord decides to comply.

Basically the show is based on a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, it is set in the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos in the Seven Kingdoms (the North, the Iron Islands, the Vale, the Westerlands, the Stormlands, the Reach, and Dorne). There are three narratives that go on throughout the show, the first being a civil war among several noble houses for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, the second being attempts to exile the descendants of the ruling dynasty to reclaim the throne, and the third being the rising threat of the inpending winter and fierce creatures and fierce people from the North. Within in the series are several plots and story lines, and a broad ensemble cast of characters, said to be the largest in television history, and winning a Guinness World Record for this. Starring Golden Globe and Emmy winning and four-time nominated Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, twice Emmy nominated Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister, twice Emmy nominated Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont, Maisie Williams as Arya Stark, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, John Bradley as Samwell Tarly, Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, Aidan Gillen as Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish, Jerome Flynn as Bronn, Conleth Hill as Lord Varys, Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister, Rory McCann as Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane, Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, Julian Glover as Grand Maester Pycelle, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Michelle Fairley as Catelyn Stark, Isaac Hempstead Wright as Bran Stark, Ian McElhinney as Barristan Selmy, Stephen Dillane as Stannis Baratheon, Ben Crompton as Eddison Tollett, Nathalie Emmanuel as Missandei, Mark Stanley as Grenn, Daniel Portman as Podrick Payne, Liam Cunningham as Davos Seaworth, Richard Madden as Robb Stark, Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell, Kristian Nairn as Hodor, Sibel Kekilli as Shae, Carice van Houten as Melisandre, Finn Jones as Loras Tyrell, Hannah Murray as Gilly, Rose Leslie as Ygritte, Kristofer Hivju as Tormund Giantsbane, Michael McElhatton as Roose Bolton, Joe Dempsie as Gendry, Jacob Anderson as Grey Worm, Ian Beattie as Meryn Trant, Owen Teale as Alliser Thorne, Vicious's Iwan Rheon as Ramsay Snow, Dominic Carter as Janos Slynt, Donald Sumpter as Maester Luwin, Natalia Tena as Osha, Esm\u00e9 Bianco as Ros, Brenock O'Connor as Olly, Ron Donachie as Rodrik Cassel, Josef Altin as Pypar, Amrita Acharia as Irri, Eugene Simon as Lancel Lannister, Michiel Huisman as Daario Naharis, James Cosmo as Jeor Mormont, Tom Wlaschiha as Jaqen H'ghar, Dean-Charles Chapman as Tommen Baratheon, Luke Barnes as Rast, Art Parkinson as Rickon Stark, Sean Bean as Eddard 'Ned' Stark, three-time Emmy nominated Dame Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell, Oona Chaplin as Talisa Maegyr, Peter Vaughan as Maester Aemon, Anton Lesser as Qyburn, Roxanne McKee as Doreah, Ben Hawkey as Hot Pie, Brian Fortune as Othell Yarwyck, Tara Fitzgerald as Selyse Baratheon, Love Actually's Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Jojen Reed, Kerry Ingram as Shireen Baratheon, Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo, Indira Varma as Ellaria Sand, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Mace Tyrell, Ellie Kendrick as Meera Reed, Gethin Anthony as Renly Baratheon, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Noah Taylor as Locke, Steven Cole as Kovarro, Callum Wharry as Tommen Baratheon, Aimee Richardson as Myrcella Baratheon, Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon, Francis Magee as Yoren, Scorpion's Elyes Gabel as Rakharo, Mackenzie Crook as Orell, Paul Kaye as Thoros of Myr, Blunder's Tony Way as Dontos Hollard, Josephine Gillan as Marei, Jonathan Pryce as High Sparrow, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Mance Rayder, Robert Pugh as Craster, The Grey's Nonso Anozie as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, Clive Russell as Brynden 'Blackfish' Tully, Casino Royale's Tobias Menzies as Edmure Tully, Jessica Henwick as Nymeria Sand, Harry Potter's Ralph Ineson as Dagmer Cleftjaw, Nell Tiger Free as Myrcella Baratheon, Harry Potter's David Bradley as Walder Frey, Mark Gatiss as Tycho Nestoris, Star Wars' Oliver Ford Davies as Maester Cressen, The Crystal Maze's Edward Tudor-Pole as Protester, Ian McShane and Max von Sydow as Three-Eyed Raven. To be completely honest, I cannot keep up with absolutely every storyline going on, because there are so many characters, in fact I have probably only memorised less than ten of the character names. The biggest reason I keep watching is because of the exciting fight and chase scenes when they happen, the great special effects to bring dragons, ghosts, zombie and all other mythical creatures to life, the over-the-top bloody violence and deaths, and the frequent nudity and sexual activity. This does not mean I do not like the show overall, I am always interested to see what will happen next with the faces of the characters I recognise, so it is certainly a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama (twice), it won the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series (also nominated), Outstanding Costumes for a Series (also nominated twice), Outstanding Makeup for a Single-Camera Series (Non-Prosthetic) (twice, also nominated), Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series (also nominated three times), Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour) (also nominated twice), Outstanding Special Visual Effects (twice, also nominated twice), and it was nominated for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series (four times), Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (four times), Outstanding Drama Series (twice), Outstanding Hairstyling for a Single-Camera Series (three times), Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie or a Special (four times), Outstanding Single- Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series (three times) and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (three times).

Some friends of mine told me about game of thrones.They compared this series with lord of the rings and when they did that...that was the final hit.I started watching the 1st season, i watched it all,every episode.Someone could say that i was inspired or even more that i was amazed. No i wasn't, it was just the needing to know.I wanted to see what was going to happen.Maybe this is the goal of the producers, maybe they don't care if you like it, they just want you to watch,to watch it all.If that is, they achieved it. But let me tell you this, this has nothing to do with lord of the rings. You are not going to see lord of the rings in a TV series version.I am not saying if this is good or bad, this depends on each one's preferences.All i am saying is that this is something completely different. Here you can enjoy corruption,anti-heroism,back-stabs,murders,ultra- violence,naked \"sausages\" and bouncing \"melons\",if you know what i mean and most of all death.As for fantasy,battles,true heroes and...fantasy, this is not the right place to be.Of course i don't believe that fantasy and battles is all that lord of the rings gives.On the opposite,lord of the rings, mostly as a book but as a film too,transfers very deep meanings. I want to add,as an answer to some reviews, that true heroes and true villains are not childish or superficial.The existence of the good and the evil symbolizes the human and his internal fight and dilemma.Talking about lord of the rings,i think that its heroes are much more realistic than the ones in the game of thrones.Every important character in lord of the rings confronts his/her bad and dark self,for example frodo and boromir did.But the target is to transfer the meaning of hope and love that's why finally comes the redemption of the characters.I didn't see this in game of thrones and i didn't like it.

More inconsistencies followed.\nThe other discomforting characterization, most all the females were flawed even Arya abandons helping to go off on her own personal quest.

It follows the standards that accompany the fantasy genre, such as knights, kings and queens, and the presence of dragons. Cersei Lannister, one of the main characters, is known for saying, \"when you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die.\" As politics seem to be getting more and more violent, Cersei Lannister seems to nod towards our violent politics and policies set in place by governments around the world. Putting a new twist on the genre, George RR Martin manages to take modern problems, such as political corruptness, and incorporate it as the main plot line of the whole show. Following 3 main plot lines, you watch as the characters battle for the title of King of the Iron Throne, the Night's Watch protects Castle Black and the rest of Westeros, and an estranged princess across the sea slowly builds an army from nothing. Game of Thrones is a show that exceeds my expectations of what fantasy should be. While it has its fair share of epic battles, knights, and far off lands, it delves so much deeper into the main characters of the show; you feel like you know each character personally, and have struggled along with them. I give Game of Thrones a A+; it combines all the aspects of a typical fantasy, with a new twist. It is a must see for those interested in this genre.", "review_date": "2 November 2017", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "abs-75657", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur74741387/", "data-review-id": "rw3810647", "short_review": "A masterpiece", "full_review": "This series could easily be considered a masterpiece as far as TV shows are concerned.

The movie-scale production is magnificent. From the smallest costume to the biggest set, it is entirely faithful to the books. The cast performances are, not only true to it's characters, but to the book design they have. I must say, however, that while season one was narrowly perfect, season two felt different. Perhaps it is because season one was, without considering minor details, completely faithful to the first book, while important plot elements where altered from the second book in the TV adaptation. The show creators have previously stated that they are not adapting \"A Game of Thrones\", \"A Clash of Kings\" and the other three books as each, but rather as the whole series \"A Song Of Ice And Fire\" which gives them freedom to move scenes and important elements. Yes, it gives them freedom to do so, but it does not give them freedom to change the story plot. They have also stated that character introduction is another reason for the changes. Perhaps this one I can live with, for in the second book there are at least thirty new characters, ten at least very important. Still, it's not impossible. Look at Boardwalk Empire! It has more characters than I can think about right now, and although Steve Buscemi's Nucky Thompson is the central character, almost every other character has it's own history. No matter what they say, in the second season, small changes like the introduction Meera and Jojen Reed where acceptable, but the changes made in the stories of Theon and especially Daenerys where just out of place. For Theon's story, there is one key character which is only mentioned, and not even by name. I seriously hope that this character is introduced in the next season because not only Theon's, but at least three other character's story is affected in the future by said character. Daenerys story changes really made me suffer to watch season two. Xaro Xhoan Daxos becoming King of Qarth? Daenerys'dragons kidnapped by Pyat Pree? And as in Theon's story, at the end of Daenerys story in the book there is at least one EXTREMELY IMPORTANT character who makes an appearance, yet in the adaptation, he was nowhere to be seen! This changes really made Daenerys story impossible to watch. No matter how good your adaptation is, or how many viewers you have, you just don't pull out important characters! Perhaps because I really loved the books is why I disliked so much this changes, but still, I hope they correct some of them in the next season, or, more precisely, I hope the creators stay truer to the books.

For those who take power it does not mean it is received but unfortunately it is given. But this element gives the edge that the show needs to be moving steadily as the most popular show on TV today. The climax is effective from episode to episode; personally I would like joffrey head on a spike. I am sure it won't cause usually he is well protected. For those who are looking for constant fight scenes and fruity ending it is not. It explores the human side and that is what I crave. Transitionally the story works with how it goes from almost every character especially Joffrey well played. Others that got me going was the first season finale I mean you cannot argue with that.

Overall, it was a decent show, but like the books it's based on, which got thicker and needed more editing as they went on, this show got shorter and more rushed. I'd put the blame for this on HBO and George Martin, who spent so much time f---ing off, writing things that didn't help finish his tale, that the writers were caught with their pants down. The first five seasons were the best, the sixth was decent, the last two rushed. There was a lot of logic lost, but if you watch and read the books, there wasn't a lot of logic there. In the books Dani sits in a fire and births the dragons, yet later, she gets burned. Ignoring this for the series was a good idea. But the magic is inconsistent, as is the action. In one episode a dragon is killed by ballista, leaving one. In the next, one dragon lays waste to Kings Landing with nary a scratch on it or Danyers. So overall, this was a decent, but not great series.

Some interesting characters and also character development within credible plots and some twists. At first I didn't like Game of Thrones and needed a second attempt to watch it.

With the start of season 5 and continuation in season 6 the show lost me, just a few good scenes and developments. I didn't read the books, just started the first one. And I think the TV show writers did a good job on the original material by GRRM. Well, till they come to season 5 and 6. In season 6 they speed up some story lines and I don't really care about most characters, how can I if I see them only a few moments in a season? Now the characters don't develop (no time for that) anymore, they just have to operate. And the writing lost it's subtle brilliance, but we get a better production value instead. I don't want to spoil and go into details, but there a some plot developments and character actions which are just poorly written, but it looks great. Obvious the makers switched focus, for me the show lost it's high value and there are better shows to watch but as I can see among my friends and reactions on the internet most people agree with the show and where it is going. For me just the bran plot line could be interesting in the future and also the white walker part and the rest seems to be predictable. In the sixth season I started reading fan theories and reviews and found more interesting plot developments among the fans than the actual TV writers.

Arya was the best for me, her character development throughout the show was amazing and she's everything a young girl would want to be.

Jon Snow never says much and there's never any narration about what he's thinking, so I don't find myself interested in him. Ygritte is better than Daeneys Targaryen from my perspective, so I was feeling uncomfortable the entire time that Daenerys and Jon were intimate with each other. Ramsay Bolton in the books was more dangerous in the books than in this show because, like I said, this show has been Hollywoodized to death to benefit the sensitive audience at the expense of quality violence, quality suspense, and quality character development. Nothing in this show was ever interesting after season 5 for me. I watched some videos on YouTube to know what happened after season 5, but I got tired of watching this because the sensitive audience that watched this show prevented characters from showing rape, genitalia, all forms of torture, and so forth.

It is one of the first series where no one ( except those who have read the books) knows what will happen. For example, we have Ed Stark at the beginning. He is the guy featured on the posters. He is the King's hand. At the end of the 1st season, he dies. Now there will be those who are disappointed, but for me I thought it was a perfect ending. Jeffery, the king's son, didn't know he was a bastard and what Stark said was treason. It shocked the audience and made me extremely happy. I have read the wiki for the next book and let me say...

I watched it for the first time during quarantine, after years of brainwashing from those around me. I can say that I fell in love with it, especially until the 5th cycle. And not to hide, while I had no idea what impact it had for so many years, I fell in love with the character of Daenerys or Khaleesi if you prefer. It happened so normally that when I decided to see it again in the last few days, I felt exactly the same. And to end up with such a scenario disappointment. A real mess! In conclusion, the series until the 5th season is definitely for a 10/10, in terms of criticism. But beyond that, without the support of books, quality is constantly declining. Probably, after 50 episodes of the first cycles, at least thirty more were needed to complete its story correctly, or maybe more. This never happened and it seems that it has damaged the series in the end and possibly its backwardness. Because, even if we accept that the final ending of the characters is the one that George R. R. Martin will show in the last books that have not been released, the way to reach this end was completely wrong and outrageous. For the 6th season I would score a total of 8/10, for the 7th hardly a 6/10 or at most 7/10. Finally, the tragic 8th season with what happened does not pass the base, so I would indulgently put a 4/10, but I think is lower. The downfall of the story of Knight King and especially Daenerys, condemns the 8th season to a low and unacceptable score for such a TV project.I believe that the series should have stopped in the 5th cycle and should not have moved beyond the books. The series eventually fell victim to its own success.

Season 8?", "full_review": "I'll address season 8 at the end of this edited review from a month ago. Benioff and Weiss have created a virtuous medieval series. This series has outstanding direction, writing, special effects, custome, cinematography, settings, score and acting. The score plays just as an important role as the characters as it often sets the tone and mood for the scene as well as a foreshadowing of events to come. The entire cast deliver superlative performances. In particular Harrington, Dinklage, Clarke, Turner and Coster-Waldau are mesmerizing. Based on Martin's series of novels, \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", the main plot revolves around two powerful families battling for control of the Seven Kingdoms and ultimately the Iron Throne. There are many subplots involved which add to the complexity and enthrallment with this series. The duplicity and betrayal among the different kingdoms as well as within the families vying for control also add to the mystery and intrigue throughout the series. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this series it's almost impossible for this viewer to choose one. The plot is gritty, violent, cunning, clever, duplicit, authentic, inventive, blazing, insightful, cathartic and captivating. If a reader decides to give it a whirl it is, in this viewer's opinion, imperative to start from the very first episode and enjoy the series from there. Each and every episode is like a single piece in a masterful puzzle. As season 7 closes the most feared enemy of all, \"The Dead\" march upon the wall not only threatening the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, but to the entire world as the characters know it. This series is a bravura work of art. It is unparalleled in it's genre both on television and film. It is memorable and will be for many years to follow. The final season just dropped and has this viewer more than elated. As far as the final season. I can understand viewers being disappointed. It was surely an enormous undertaking trying to bring complete closure to this masterful series while trying to maintain it's superiority in the genre and it's integrity. I myself felt like the aforementioned. However, I thought about two points. The first is at least HBO, Benioff and Weiss didn't make, \"GOT\" worldwide fanbase of millions wait 13 years to bring closure as was the case with, \"Deadwood\" which as is to Old West fans as \"GOT\" is to medieval fans. The second is that they did not drag the series out to an extent that could have given rise to a loss of the series' magnificence entirely. At least I was finally able not only to choose a favorite scene, but a complete episode which is in season 8, ep. 3. As cliche as it is, all good things must come to an end or in this case an ending.", "review_date": "15 May 2019", "rating_value": "9"}]}, {"ImdbId": "tt0944947", "reviews": [{"reviewer_name": "alged-92795", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur102026365/", "data-review-id": "rw4847174", "short_review": "Nice beautiful Nice beautiful Nice beautiful", "full_review": "Fantastic episode nice beautiful\nNice beautiful Nice beautiful", "review_date": "13 May 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "sachiendra", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur69902096/", "data-review-id": "rw3586500", "short_review": "Inclusive of all cultures of the world", "full_review": "It is an excellent Series.

The characters are well fleshed out you understand everyone's motives. One character, in particular, Jaime Lannister he went from being someone you are supposed to hate and someone who is not trustworthy to be one of the most beloved characters you feel sad for him, you want him to succeed, and achieve whatever he wants by the end of the show that's really good character writing. All the other characters also had amazing journeys Theon Greyjoy for one had a very sad journey and when it comes to Sansa Stark she was a kid at the beginning of the show and you see her journey to becoming a strong woman. My point is almost all the characters were great!The CGI for dragons was breathtaking it is probably the best CGI dragon I have ever seen. But now let's talk about the issues with the show:One of my biggest complaint with the show is that why did they build-up White walkers for so long (literally for 7 seasons) and then there was no payoff to that it's like they came destroyed a few small villages and a war at Winterfell and that's all!? Arya Stark does all this training which went on for something like 2 seasons was for the most part useless she never used her training what was all that build-up for when you are never going to do anything about it!?Tyrion Lannister now another character who for no reason all of a sudden became dum in last two season.Cersei Lannister now another character who was supposed to be an antagonist had no pay-offs in season 8 you get to see her for like one episode! All in all Game of Thrones sets up amazing ideas for its future instalments but instead in absolutely fails at doing justice to the show and we can a very disappointing season 8 which just feels like it was not worth watching 7 seasons of this show as we literally get no pay-off whatsoever.

It is hard to love or hate one specific character throughot all seasons, in other words, to have one favorite character or personal hero as they all evolve and grow both physically and mentally. This series challenges the boundaries what is okay to be shown in serieses both in plots and visually. If you can handle severe explicit scenes with nudity and violence which are essential parts of this then you'll definitely like it, but there is also more to Game of Thrones than this surface. My personal takeaway is that it clearly shows that human behaviour may strive for goodness or justice, but that human nature itself is flawed because we are human after all. Moreover, Game of Thrones is neither black or white though a dynamic grey area where good may become evil and evil may become good or where you have a state of both existing simultaneously. While many side stories have been building up continously over many episodes, I don't see the point of how some of them were important in the end after all e.g. what happened to Bran Stark and why it was so important in the end. And, some of the side stories were also too shallow leaving out deeper insights behind them. The last episode, or even the last episodes, felt too rushed and the storyline felt missing some points once in a while at some situations.

One episode you hated cercei for being cruel, and the next season you wanted her to seek revenge from high sparrow. One could easily get lost in this fantasy world. Up until season 8! When everything became a chaos. Writing was awful, stories didn't make sense, and people's motivation was unrealistic. I'm not saying that Dany going crazy was unrealistic, on the contrary I always felt like she was so cruel. What bothered me was the inconsistency in writing material. It just didn't make sense! I guess writers were so much focused on coming up with plot twists that in the end they chose the most unrealistic ending just for the sake of shock element! I mean bran becoming the king was so unconvincing. And Jon going to night's watch?! Probably the fact that books are not finished had an impact on the quality of writing; writers didn't have material to refer to. One could easily see this; many dialogues were repeating what we have already heard on earlier seasons, and characters backstories flop. All in all, got is one of the biggest shows on TV history, I would love to rewatch episodes from seasons 1 to 7. But the final season was a failure.", "review_date": "20 May 2019", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "lucasd-12944", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur102206581/", "data-review-id": "rw4872401", "short_review": "Best show ever", "full_review": "Overall this show is amazing.

Fantastic writing and acting across the board, but some disappointing moments best forgotten. Season 1 though 6 of GOT are incredible, and everyone deserves a watch. You will never see anything like it. Regardless of how people feel regarding it's finish, everyone should be excited for what the future holds. Game of Thrones has set the bar for T.V shows and T.V enthusiasts should be ecstatic for what comes next regarding shows. Writers and Directors learn from each other and will look up to Game of Thrones as inspiration for their work. This is what I am most excited about; not the spin offs that I am confident will be coming soon, but the shows that will become even better than Thrones.

I didn't really care as much for the first season due to the lack of action, but as the series progressed, I could not stop watching. Season 2 improved on season 1, but season 3 raised the stakes even higher and gave some of Game of Thrones most famous best moments in the shows history (Red Wedding anyone?). But season 4 displayed the show at its best and it's most engaging, with episodes like the Lion and the Rose, the Mountain and the Viper and The Watchers on the Wall, which sadly concluded Jon Snows and Ygrittes story arc. Game of Thrones just kept on getting better and better until we got Season 5. While I do not hate this season, it's nowhere near as good as seasons 3 and 4. The Sand Snakes and bad dialogue are mostly the main reason why this season falls short compared to the other seasons and the episode Unbowed, Unbent and Unbroken is by far the worst episode in Game of Thrones history. This season still had many great moments such as the best battle in my opinion in Game of Thrones history the battle of Hardhome. Many great battles and visuals overall and I thought it was slightly better than season 1 but still, not nearly as good as season 2, 3 and 4. Now we get to season 6. Season 6 made up for some of the bad parts of season 5 with a lots of spectacle. We got the Battle of the Bastards, which is one of the greatest Game of Thrones battles in history, the Death of Ramsay Bolton, the Hodor thing, Jon Snow's resurrection, The Winds of Winter episode which is one of the best episodes in Game of Thrones history and the reveal of Jon Snow's past. Definitely one of the best seasons of Game of Thrones. Then we get to season 7. Season 7 was almost comparable to season 5 but I liked this season overall. I loved the battles with Euron Greyjoy attacking the Sand Snakes and Yara's fleet and most notably the Lannisters vs the Dothraki and Drogon that battle competes with Hardhome and the Battle of the Bastards as one of the best battles in the series history. There were a few missteps in terms of dialogue and how characters were able to travel long distances in short periods of time but overall, this season was pretty good and I can't wait for next season.

Season four not so good. Season 5?

I started the show during the third season but have since invested a lot of time to the book series and have started to understand the amazing complexity that George RR Martin has weaved throughout his emotional masterpiece. Sadly, the TV show cant replicate this complexity of each character development and plot line but it can give the audience an enjoyable, funny, clever but somewhat lacking version of ASOIAF. If one watches the show without the books, one will enjoy the events even though they are tough to witness and recall the tragedies of recent emotional stories such as the Wire. But a book reader will be ultimately left with a shallow view of the multi dimensional stories that they have read throughout 5 books. The performances are excellent but the characters themselves pale next to the complex characteristics of each character in terms of psychology and what GRR Martin considers the apex of ASOIAF: The human heart in conflict with itself.", "review_date": "19 November 2015", "rating_value": "8"}, {"reviewer_name": "sterlingguilherme", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur63283660/", "data-review-id": "rw3338258", "short_review": "A review for the Game Of Thrones series", "full_review": "", "review_date": "19 October 2015", "rating_value": ""}, {"reviewer_name": "Landgraab", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur57901608/", "data-review-id": "rw3314752", "short_review": "Politics in Game of Thrones", "full_review": "", "review_date": "10 September 2015", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "lightningsrl", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur30534029/", "data-review-id": "rw3258494", "short_review": "Las episode of season 5", "full_review": "Considering episode 9 I was expecting much more from the season finale unfortunately there's only two words that can describe this last episode BIG DISAPPOINTMENT ... if you add to that, that we have to wait one year for the next episode / season it becomes more than that, it becomes TOTAL FAILURE with the added bonus of ruining the whole thing. So besides being total crap the actual story didn't develop much as you would expect from a season finale episode but on the contrary it left a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT feeling. The show is one of the best currently there's no denying in that and it had up's and down's like all have and so far it was good and entertaining, too bad about this last episode it was like the creators run out of ideas / lack of inspiration / professionalism. I can understand to leave some things unresolved that creates the desire to see next season in viewers but to add new stuff and let them also (totally) unexplained is amateur work, it should have been an \"explosive\" season finale considering the previous episode which was very good and raised my expectations for the finale a lot. I wont probably remember next year to watch the next season because of the bitterness I felt with this season finale.
