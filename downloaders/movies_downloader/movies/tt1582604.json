I am a north Indian and haven&apos;t watched any of Ballaya&apos;s movie. Though I have watched more than 50 Telugu movies till now, a Ballaya movie has still eluded me. After watching the teasers of SIMHA on you tube, I finally booked tickets for it. When the movie started, it felt like a usual feast, especially because of Namitha mainly. Though Ballaya looked a little old for Sriman Narayana&apos;s role, but he seemed serious. The first half was overall average, the usual fights sequences, villains making grueling faces, heroins drooling over Ballaya and all. However post intermission movie turned out to be much better. The Narasimha role suited Ballaya very well. He looked every bit of that fiery tiger. Nayanthara looked royal and elegant. Sneha Ullal seemed lost, while Namitha looked ugly, she is too fat even for being a porn star now."}, "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingCount": 1437, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 5.9}, "contentRating": "Not Rated", "genre": ["Action", "Drama"], "datePublished": "2010-04-30", "keywords": "cutting one&apos;s throat,multiple stabbings,crying,waking up from a coma,slitting one&apos;s throat", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Simha (2010) Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi909623577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDMyOWVjMzgtMmJiOS00Y2I1LThjY2YtNzNjOWM3MDE4YjRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDMyOWVjMzgtMmJiOS00Y2I1LThjY2YtNzNjOWM3MDE4YjRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A Tale of Father and Son who brings down Injustice in their reign."}, "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0049395/", "name": "Nandamuri Balakrishna"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0019382/", "name": "Ali"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9585396/", "name": "Saira Banu"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2264823/", "name": "Boyapati Srinu"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "/company/co0311170/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2375127/", "name": "M.
