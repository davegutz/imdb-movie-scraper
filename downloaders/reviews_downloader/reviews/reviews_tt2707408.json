This TV series is great not just because it illustrates to us the most significant era of drug traffickers, as a documentary; the narration of the whole story also shows respect to Magical realism style, which also originated from Colombia. Things could happen to shock you in every second, far beyond normality and your expectation, but in the context, they seem to make perfect sense as for that time, in that place, with those people who were born in a world where nothing is expectable.\nFor me, the \"realism\" attracts my deep thinking all the time while I watch the series. Pablo Escobar is definitely one of the focused character, and he is surely vicious, ambitious and cruel and one would not describe him as a \"normal guy\". But quite a lot of scenes showed me a different part of such an evil criminal that contradicts with his apparent impression, especially when we see how he values loyalty, how much he loves his wife and children, how he would try all possible or impossible to protect and insure his family members' wellbeing. In these moments, his image seems a bit different and, seems a bit hard to say, he shows his good, sweet and normal side as being a human.\nThis kind of dramatic effect is emphasized in S01E09, when Pablo had to stayed in his father's house to temporarily avoid police chasing. This episode leaves me the deepest impression and I would like to talk more about it. When old Escobar accidently got blood on Pablo's shirt and ironically commented: Funny that you don't like blood. Here I saw one of the greatest acting in the series, when the toughly maintained, fragile father and son relationship finally broke down at the moment, or as it already did many years ago when their interest and value distinct from each other's. Pablo surely desired to be a great man, he thought and wished his outstanding power and wealth would make his father proud of him, for they are no longer the poor and insignificant mud that can be stepped on by the superior, for tomorrow's food and cloth is no longer a concern. But at the end of the day, his father is ashamed, disappointed, regretful; more than any fathers in the world and Pablo learned this truth finally. When I watched season 2, Pablo's failing is gradual, with his drug kingdom teared down piece by piece; but it is also in a flash, when something that you would not expect to matter at all for someone ruthless like this, finally breaks his fortress and ambition. Very dramatic and like a magic, all is gone like wind, all is left is a tired, aged bulky guy who found his great deeds meaningless and his ambition, vanished. I also see how he might start with a small ambition, gaining a bit more respect and money, until greediness and power overtakes him, which is followed by supreme victory, and equally significant burst of his dream in the bubble. But Pablo's death will never mark the end of all these, \"dreamers\" would keep sprouting one after the other on this land, watered by the constant rain and inequality on this land.\nIn some way the story coincides with the cycle of Buendia's family under Macondo's pen, constant repetition of one's fate despite the struggle and fight, as it is determined, the reality.\nIf you ask me to define magic, I would just say, it is something that surprise you. Agent Steve describe it as a disappearance magic when Pe\u00f1a was asked to return to USA. The same for me when Colonel Martinez, someone I really like, was dead and gone all of a sudden, without any time or signal for you to get ready. I once thought he is an important role and won't die easily and the show just hit me for being na\u00efve. Yep, the war is fair in this way, everyone is made of fresh and blood and no one is more significant than the others, when it's time for you to die, you will.", "review_date": "11 January 2020", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "martinraggett182-564-31246", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur38968570/", "data-review-id": "rw5126042", "short_review": "One of the best series ever!", "full_review": "10/10 for acting, filming, sticking to the true facts.

The biggest is the need for subtitles. These people are infants in my opinion. The use of the native language in this series lends to its immersive nature and authenticity to this show and would be a vital missing component if done completely in english. The second is that it glorifies violence and criminal activity. It is a docudrama people. The story is told, to the best of it's ability, as it happened. Again, I feel these people are infants that probably watch reality television as their primary entertainment consumption. This show is excellent in every way. Production quality, awesome locations, beautiful cinamotography, absolutely top notch acting and script writing that is sublime. No documentary series in televison history has gripped me like this show. I would highly encourage that anyone who hasnt seen it yet, remedy that fact as soon as possible.

Negative points: way too much narration, which distances the viewer from the action and is also very uncinematic - half the time it's telling you what you can see already. Lead actor Boyd Holbrook is dreadful and has zero presence on screen. No time is really taken to flesh out the subsidiary characters, unlike in - say - The Sopranos, where each one of these dreadful people was fully rounded with good points and flaws. And finally, there is way too much sex that exists purely to get some breasts on camera to titillate male viewers (witness the scene between Moncada and his wife in the bath, which could just as easily have been done at the breakfast table).

I loved the way they told the story and I was impressed by many of the the actors. Specially Andres Parra who plays Pablo. Luckily enough I speak Spanish fluently and had no need for subtitles. Having this to compare with I noticed that the US version of the story, 'Narcos', had changed a lot of important things, had crammed things together and also invented a few new things I had problems believing. For starters the focus of the 'Narcos' is to show how thanks to USA and the work of an American in Colombia they where able to catch Escobar. But they left out the story of people that where really affected by him and the people that really did all the hard work. The Colombian newspapers, journalists, politicians, police and military.

And I agree. I hate that in television the only time people refer to Colombia is in relation to drugs and narcotraffic. But that is not the thing that bothers me the most. It is the fact that while movies and series can talk about this subject, because unfortunately it indeed happened, they do so without the minimum knowledge about our country's culture and delicate history. I can't tell you how many times I've seen the portrayal of my country as a place where apparently cities are very poor villages, and all the people living in them have Mexican accents regardless if they are from Bogot\u00e1, Medellin or Cartagena (yes, all of these cities have different accents. Very different ones.) And apparently we are a people waiting for the Americans to save us from ourselves. So when Narcos was released I was reluctant to watch the series. I didn't want to see one more single Hollywood-style show about my country. It wasn't until I read an article of a Colombian guy talking about this series, that I decided to establish my own opinion about it. I've only watched the first six episodes and I have to say is not as bad as I expected. I respect the fact that the producers of this show took the time to study our history and the events that have happened, to make an accurate series about the terrible times Colombia has gone through, and I am thankful for that. I know all the actors are not Colombian, heck even the main character is from Brazil, and I know the accents are not even close to what they should be, but at least it doesn't fall under the category \"just another show about 'Colombia'.\" However, there were things that bothered me. The show is not 100% accurate, and many scenes are very dramatized because after all, it's still Hollywood, and the acting along with the lines of some characters are not the best. But the main problem is how a show that tries to work so close with the actual history, runs through it as if they had a time limit. Some of the most important events in Colombia, such as The Palace of Justice's siege, were shown lightly, without giving them the tremendous importance that they actually had. This just makes me question if the show is really about what happened here, or about how the U.S \"saved us all.\"", "review_date": "25 October 2015", "rating_value": "6"}, {"reviewer_name": "jschultz-57607", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur85233185/", "data-review-id": "rw5662589", "short_review": "Better than I thought would be", "full_review": "Started kinda boring , tried a few times to watch.

I see other people saying that these show is the same as the others narcos shows like: El Cartel De Los Sapos, El Patr\u00f3n Del Mal, Bloque De B\u00fasqueda, Alias JJ, El Se\u00f1or De Los Cielos and the list goes on and goes on.

The quality of the music in these show, the actors used to represent all the characters (especially the role of Jorge Salcedo personified by Mart\u00edn Varela was the best of the 3 Narcos seasons so far, even better than the recognized Pedro Pascal as Pe\u00f1a, Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar and Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar as Gilberto Rodr\u00edguez) and the beauty of the setting make these show the best TV show in history when the 95% of the actors speak in the Spanish language.And I feel very proud of that as puertorican, because a lot of the music used in the show by the genre of \"Salsa\" comes from my island like: H\u00e9ctor Lavoe, Ismael Rivera, Cheo Feliciano, Angel Canales and the list goes and goes on and bring an unique caribbean flavor to the show. Of course, I'm not proud of the actions committed by all those narcos, but it's important to know the history of our brother country, Colombia. My only complaint is some of the actor accents, but what the ****, if you want quality actors you need to let that triviality pass. Hell, I expect that the next season will be based in the ruthless empire of Orlando Henao Montoya and the Cartel del Norte Del Valle and I assume by the popularity of these show the producers will continue these show with the mexicans drug kingpins that rise after the destruction of Cali Cartel, Medell\u00edn Cartel and Norte Del Valle Cartel.

The opening theme gets a lot of well deserved praise, but the score music is so amazing and really brings you into the characters mindsets aswell as pumping adrenaline through your veins.", "review_date": "16 March 2021", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "jakubkusnierz", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur128741939/", "data-review-id": "rw6696122", "short_review": "This series is amazing", "full_review": "This series is amazing !

Pablo Escobar is the real life version of \"Baba yaga\" from John Wick. He was one of the richest people on the planet. He was also the largest cocaine trafficker on the planet. He would also be, by today's standards, simply called a terrorist. He murdered anyone who stood in his way and countless other innocents along the way. I've read a few books on Pablo and I have to say this series TOTALLY does justice to the real story. The writing, directing and acting is unbelievable! I have to admit that personally I feel a little dirty because in some of the scenes I am actually empathizing and relating to Pablo...I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM SAYING THAT!!! The people in charge of this series do such a fantastic job in splitting your allegiances. When Pablo's cousin is killed I literally had to shake my head because even though Escobar is an evil disgusting human being who has destroyed countless lives and brought both Columbia and the US to their knees (and I know this intellectually) I can still relate with him and feel his pain and I found myself devilishly routing for him and I was eagerly anticipating his revenge for for that killing...I WAS FEELING FOR PABLO FREAKING ESCOBAR! Then a few scenes later the DEA agent is kissing babies and planning to go outside of the law to bring him down and I'm back routing for these guys to take that evil person off the streets. Rarely have I encountered such a deep and in depth emotional roller coaster as I have experienced watching this show. These guys deserve a ton of credit. Top notch job. I am fascinated and totally engrossed in watching this ideological DEA agent succumb to his primal urge to take out this evil presence regardless of the moral boundaries he has to cross to do so. My favorite quote from the entire series is \"Yeah...I like Olivia\" (It reminds me of the premise of another movie I recently watched called \"The Man of Tai Chi\" which explores the voyeuristic culture we live in where we love to watch innocence being destroyed by the evil that surrounds us). In Narcos this premise is displayed with such skill that I have to bow my head.

Along with that Holbrook's and Pascal's subtle and sarcastic narrative adds to the intensity of the series. Pascal, Holbrook and Moura deliver top notch realistic performances. The series depicts the efforts of two agents from different countries working together to take down the cartels and the obstacles they faced. It addresses the drug trade from all points of view including law enforcement, politicians, traffickers, media and the victims left in the wake. The most notable kingpin targeted is Pablo Escobar and unless you've been living under a rock, that name is well known. The plot of the show is nearly flawless and makes it clear as to what it took to take down Escobar. It's captivating throughout the series. The writers made it clear during the three seasons that if you cut off the head of the snake, another figure will be standing in line to take it's place. The ending leaves the viewer with this realization and also eludes to the fact that the story is just beginning.

It deserves it. Everything that has been said positively about it, I agree with: storyline, direction, acting, screenplay, scenography, editing, and the production are top notch. My only slight disappointment was the \"non-Spanish\" accent I detected on the actor that plays Escobar from the get go, and my Google search told me that he's Brazilian, which made sense. The question of \"why didn't they find/couldn't they find\" a Colombian actor for this part crossed my mind. HOWEVER, Mr. Moura does have the \"paisa\" sing-song way of speaking down to a \"T\", and his acting is very good, which made it easy for me to involuntarily forget about that detail. Besides, the rest of the main and supporting cast is so good and they bring together such a good balance, that it made the story and the relationships between all the characters flow very smoothly. My main dislike was Mr. Luis Guzman's characterization of Gacha because I feel that the actor, who is of Puerto Rican ascent in real life, could not give his character a more South American flavor. I think Mr. Guzman was a miscast 100%. Also, I found highly interesting that so much real footage from different events that occurred during that time was added. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the production level. Fantastic job, Netflix! BTW - for those reviewers that had a real problem with Mr. Moura's non-Colombian accent, I suggest you listen again, or for the first time, Al Pacino's accent on \"Scarface\". Just awful and ridiculous. Mr. Moura's \"not real\" Colombian accent is not even a 1/8 of that \"not real\" Cuban train wreck, and that was Al \"Oscar Winner\" Pacino.", "review_date": "8 September 2015", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "lawrencefishler", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur62529538/", "data-review-id": "rw3312509", "short_review": "One Of The Best Shows Of The Year", "full_review": "Narcos is a show on Netflix that is a biographical drama about the rise and fall of the most notorious drug lord in all of Colombia, Pablo Escobar.

The main thing that stroke me was the non Hollywood like production vibe (that i was actually expecting). The vibe is more genuine and noir (in a way) and really authentic (film locations and Spanish speaking actors!) The Spanish speaking really ads up to genuine vibe (I was really surprised!) many non main characters are actually Colombian with the Colombian Spanish accent (well done!). Reconstruction with details (clothing, military uniforms, vehicles etc...) are precise and you can tell there was genuine history research. Kudos! Only eventual downside to it is that, although actors are terrific, Pablo's Character (+ mother and wife) might not be welcome in a proper way by South American audience As they clearly don't speak in Colombian Spanish.

They feature a horse more than once being forced to carry around a full grown man on his or her back while doing this stupid fast walk to the music. They also show caged chickens. Animals used in the entertainment industry are always harmed. The most effective way to force an animals to do meaningless tricks on demand is with negative reinforcement. The company that says \"no animals were harmed in the making of this show\" is a lie, and that is because they don't monitor the treatment of the animal off set (such as the training methods or the living conditions of the animal), nor do they monitor the treatment of the animals when the camera isn't rolling. That means abuse between takes is totally allowable. On top of that, they are self-regulated, and have been caught on multiple occasions providing this seal of approval even though there is documented animal abuse and even death occurring during filming. Once the animal is old and no longer considered usable for entertainment, they are often warehoused or cast to roadside zoos where they spend the rest of their lives languishing in deplorable conditions. I assume that the animal abuse carries on throughout the show, considering it was so prevalent in the first episode. Narcos would be an ever better show if it stopped supporting animal abuse and perpetuating the idea that intelligent animals are ours to use for cheap entertainment.", "review_date": "12 October 2015", "rating_value": "4"}, {"reviewer_name": "albarracingiovanny", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur107970370/", "data-review-id": "rw5135747", "short_review": "Don't like it", "full_review": "The cast was not colombian at all, they even did not have the proper accent.

Murphy is neither saint nor sinner, but a likable, relatable figure, doing his best to make sense out of the chaos that was Colombia in the 80's. Wagner Moura's portrayal of Pablo Escobar--part evil genius, part paranoid--is nuanced and riveting. And it should be mentioned that even though men drive the story in Narcos, there is still room for interesting female characters. Unlike many shows about violent subcultures, the women are far more than simply props in Narcos. Full kudos to Netflix for producing yet another adult, intelligent show.

Well executed. Season 1 and 2 showed the fall of Pablo Escobar and it was one hell of a ride. This series depicts the Columbian cartels during the 80's. The entire production is superbly crafted. The construction and pacing of the narrative immerses the viewer inside the drug trafficking underbelly. The storyline revolves around the efforts of two agents from different countries working together to take down the cartels and the obstacles they faced. It addresses the drug trade from all points of view including law enforcement, politicians, traffickers, media and the victims left in the wake. What I learned from this series, narcos dealings were never be clean. Lot of people died even they are narcos members or public victims . For example, in one episode, Pablo Escobar use a young man to bring a briefcase containing bomb that explode the plane..young man died..then Pablo Escobars' people went down to the young man house and killed his beloved wife. They want to kill that baby too but the DEA agents safe them first. The most notable kingpin targeted is Pablo Escobar and unless you've been living under a rock, that name is well known. It's pure, raw and gritty. The writers made it clear during the three seasons that if you cut off the head of the snake, another figure will be standing in line to take it's place. The ending leaves the viewer with this realization and also eludes to the fact that the story is just beginning.He was a very smart person and he run his business in many types of ways,he made a lot of money ! On the other side he also made many rivals,and that cause him defeat in the end,whoever came to his path to stop him he sent his man to kill him,he killed lot of police officers in his time.he made huge property,house,cars,villa,weapons .Pablo loved his family very much,he always take care of his family. Pablo Escobar was a romantic husband to her wife, and being good to his mother..even what he did was totally wrong, but giving wealth to your family is a dream of every men in this world. You won't find terribly long and boring moments during an episode for which The Walking Dead is infamous. Narcos describes narcotrafficking in the mind of psychopath entrepreneur. It's exhilarating and terrifying. It makes you wonder what kind of tactic the narcotraffickers are going to use next to overwhelm their adversaries.

When i came across NARCOS, I thought it was a documentary but I quickly realized it wasn't. This should be on TV but because of some of the nudity, which took me by surprise, I understand why they cant show this on TV. The production is amazing. The story-line is spectacular. The blend of real facts and some made up is amazing. You can't even tell whats real or whats made up. I am really upset because season 2 is so far away and I am on the last episode. :( But i will be waiting for this to come back on. If you haven't watched......you need to. This show is the best show I have ever seen so far.", "review_date": "2 May 2016", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "nicola-170", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur15996732/", "data-review-id": "rw3435230", "short_review": "Strong as the man who's story is told", "full_review": "", "review_date": "21 March 2016", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "umerzaman", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur62680144/", "data-review-id": "rw3408979", "short_review": "F***king hell of TV show", "full_review": "", "review_date": "5 February 2016", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "TheParatrooper", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur37801945/", "data-review-id": "rw3399218", "short_review": "10/10", "full_review": "Extremely interesting and attracting movie that I highly recommend to all the movie fans out there! It has a lot of interesting scenes and videos from real reports on television that makes the movie even more and more interesting, plus the fact that there is all the time movie speaker that involves you more and more with the story itself. If you are fan of the dark deals and crime scenes this is the movie for you. The actors are playing very well specially the main actor that plays Pablo Escobar. My opinion about himself is that he have very good deep voice and he is the perfect choice for the role given by the Directors of the movie.", "review_date": "20 January 2016", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "blazingwater02", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur33570243/", "data-review-id": "rw3398944", "short_review": "Narcos, hola Senorias!", "full_review": "One of the best series I have seen in recent years.

It is interesting to see the very primitive ways in which the CIA had to monitor people.

I love the rawness of the narrator. I was pretty disappointed with who they used for Pablo. In real life, he was a man that gave you a sense of fear and dominance. I didn't get that feeling from this actor. Probably because he had a horrible paisa accent. His Spanish was actually hard to understand sometimes. Being the main character of the series, I thought that was a very poor choice the makers made; which is the reason I didn't rate this series higher. For non-Spanish speakers, it's irrelevant, but I would've loved to get the full effect of a true paisa.

Although I do understand that Netflix wants to appeal to a global viewership, I must admit that the inaccuracy of many of the accents was very distracting. So it was the lack of Spanish fluency in some of the actors \"forced\" to speak in Spanish. Also, I do not agree with some of the nativist comments -nor endorse English as the lingua franca- but the bilingual format was not very successful -in my view. Production values are high but I have seen several Colombian narco telenovelas that are better product than Narcos.
